1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,090
Okay, let's suppose we have a nice
big beautiful pandas dataframe and

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,700
this time read in a lot of data.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,340
We didn't just focus on a few days,
we've got the data all the way from

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:19,240
the beginning of 2010 to 2012 and we
got data for SPY, IBM, Google and GLD.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,910
Now suppose we want to focus
on just a subset of that data.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,170
In fact, we might call that a slice.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,634
For instance, what if we wanted
to look at just the values for

8
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:36,457
Google and GLD between these dates,
February 13,

9
00:00:36,457 --> 00:00:40,960
2010 through February 15, 2010, and

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,839
we want to again just look at Google and
GLD.

11
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:51,200
Well there's very beautiful syntax in
Pandas that allows you to do that.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,670
So we're going to be learning a lot more
about this syntax in a later lesson.

13
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,550
But this is sort of a preview of
the very nice things you can do.

14
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,882
To select these rows we do a simple
statement that they will show

15
00:01:03,882 --> 00:01:07,260
you later to create a date time object.

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,280
And we just put the start
date colon end date.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:21,690
And if we just write df1[sd:ed] where
this is start date and that's end date,

18
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:28,470
then we end up With these three rows,
but we want to be more selective.

19
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,220
We want to focus on these three rows and
these columns and

20
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,290
we need to add one more piece of
syntax that indicates these columns.

21
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:44,480
So this statement will extract
these rows and these columns,

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,540
and leave you just with this
sub-portion or slice of df1.

23
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,520
So, if we were to execute
the statement df2 equals df1,

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,740
and then this additional syntax,
we will end up with this

25
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:06,670
little morsel of data right
here in our new dataframe.

26
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,810
Now there's lots of different ways
you can slice the data, you don't

27
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,050
have to take a group of pieces of data
that are right next to each other.

28
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,850
You can grab any different columns you
want and any different rows you want.

29
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,340
So you might build a new
dataframe by taking GLD and IBM.

30
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,210
And it'll just take those two
columns and splat them into df2.

31
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,710
So that's slicing.

32
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,980
This is just a brief introduction.

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,740
We're going to go into some
deeper examples when we get

34
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,390
to the lesson on numbpie.
