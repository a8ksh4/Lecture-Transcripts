1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,670
Continuing on,
let's read the csv file for SPY.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,500
In dfSPY, a temporary DataFrame.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,970
The next step is the heart of
building the final DataFrame.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:19,690
We combine the empty DataFrame, df1,
with the temporary DataFrame, dfSPY.

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,410
We use the join function of
the DataFrame for this purpose.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:23,965
Let's do it.

7
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:28,980
DataFrame.join does
a left join by default.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,500
So if we write a.join b,
it will read in all the rules from a,

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,410
but only those rules from b whose
index values are present in a's index.

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,758
For the remaining rows, that is
the index values, not present in b,

11
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:48,040
pandas introduce nans.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:54,180
So in this case, all the rules from
the df1 will be retained and we will get

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,410
all the values for the prizes from dfSPY
for the given range we defined above.

14
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,190
So in our case, all the rules
from the df1 will be retained and

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,960
only those rules of dfSPY, which is
present in df1, will be retained.

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,740
This will give us all the prices for
the stock SPY in the defined date range.

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,840
Let's use join df1 one after
the join step to make it clear.

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,770
You should expect to see all
the values of SPY for the given dates.

19
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,230
Observe the output.

20
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,570
We did not get any
values from the dfSpy.

21
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,320
What do you think?

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,224
What could be the reason?

23
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:38,285
Let's print dfSPY to investigate.

24
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:41,100
Commenting out the join lines.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,925
So let's see what dfSPY has.

26
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:49,231
We told pandas to join df1, and dfSPY.

27
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:52,480
But dfSPY has an index of integers,

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,360
which is not the same as
the dates index that df1 uses.

29
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,660
We fix this by informing
the read_csv function,

30
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,580
that the date column in the csv
file should be used as index.

31
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,740
We do this by using
the index_col parameter.

32
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,590
Make sure you give
the correct column name.

33
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,110
We also want the dates present in
the DataFrame to be converted into date

34
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,850
time index objects.

35
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,720
This can be done by setting the value
for the parse_dates parameter to True.

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,710
Let's see if this works.

37
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,060
Notice that the Date column is
now being used as the index.

38
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,750
There is no separate
integer index on the left.

39
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,840
Now let's see what the resulting
join DataFrame looks like

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,430
by uncommenting these lines.

41
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,140
But before that, let's add some more
parameters to the read_csv function.

42
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,060
Note that we are interested in just
two columns, which is the Date and

43
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,760
the Adj Close.

44
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,380
We can get rid of the other column,

45
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,030
by using the usecols
parameter of the read_csv.

46
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,545
We pass a list of column name we
are interested in, which are Date and

47
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:05,790
Adj Close.

48
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,920
Now let's see what's there in df1.

49
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:15,100
You see now we have just the Adj Close
for the SPY for a given date range.

50
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,010
Also observe that weekend
dates have NaN value.

51
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:25,490
Before we go ahead,
let's understand that csv NaN as string,

52
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:30,930
so we need to tell the read_csv that NaN
should be interpreted as not a number.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,480
This is how you indicate it.

54
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,530
One last step.

55
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,970
We just want the date,
on which SPY traded, so

56
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,200
we can add more stocks
based on these dates.

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,420
Let's drop the rows where SPY is NaN.

58
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,315
For this, we use the dropna function.

59
00:03:49,315 --> 00:03:57,090
df1.dropna will drop all the rows
which has NaN values for the SPY.

60
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,450
Let's go ahead and print this.

61
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,390
Now we have built a clean DataFrame
filled with SPY data using

62
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,320
a selected date range and keeping
only the dates that SPY traded on.
