1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,660
Note that we use two steps for
combining the data frames.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,450
That is left joining the empty
data frame with dfSPY, and

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,590
then dropping the rows
that SPY did not trade on.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,180
This can be done in a single step using
the how argument when calling join.

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,770
Can you figure out what the appropriate
value of how should be?

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,720
Type it in the box.
