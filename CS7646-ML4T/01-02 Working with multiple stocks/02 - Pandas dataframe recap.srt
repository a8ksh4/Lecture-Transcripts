1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,440
Okay, in this lesson,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,710
we're going to dive into how do we fill
a dataframe with the data that we want.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,720
And we're also going
to touch upon a couple

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,550
issue that we had that were pointed
out in the previous lesson.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,180
For instance, remember when we had that
issue that the dates were actually in

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,090
the reverse order when we loaded
them in, we're going to fix that.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,660
We're going to fix
a couple other things too.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,470
Okay, just to refresh your memory,
here's the kind of stuff that goes in

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,430
a dataframe, our columns are the
particular symbols of stocks that we're

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,050
interested in, and our rows are dates.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,650
So time, goes from the top of
the dataframe down to the bottom, and

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,470
symbols, from left to right.
