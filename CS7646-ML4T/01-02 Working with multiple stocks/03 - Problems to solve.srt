1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,968
So in order to get to
a dataframe like this,

2
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:05,418
we've got a couple of problems to solve.

3
00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:06,840
And we're going to solve
them in this lesson.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,610
So one of the first issues is we want
to be able to read in particular

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,070
date ranges.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,951
So if you remember from the last lesson,
we just read all of it in.

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,469
But what if we just want to
read in a certain part of it,

8
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:24,068
instead of from 1995 to 2012.

9
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:27,557
What if we want, say, just 2010 to 2012?

10
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:30,305
Well, we gotta figure
out how to solve that.

11
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:35,309
Something that's very special about
Pandas, and one of the things

12
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,330
that makes it very powerful,
is that we can index the rows by dates.

13
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,840
We don't have to just use a single
number like zero for instance.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,120
We need to be able to read in multiple
stocks, instead of just, say having one.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,980
We want to have SPY, IBM,
Google, and Gold all at once.

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,350
We need to be able to align dates.

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,530
For instance,
If GLD traded on particular days and

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,200
SPY traded on particular days we want
to make sure that those line up, so

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,300
that for each row we have
the correct information for

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,140
each equity on that particular date.

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,150
Finally, we need to undo that problem
that we discovered in the last lesson.

22
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,240
Namely that these dates and the files
we read them from are in reverse order.

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,890
So, we want to be sure that we have
them in the right order when we're

24
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,500
processing them.

25
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,790
So, these are the tasks we're
going to dig into in this lesson.
