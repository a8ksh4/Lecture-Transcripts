1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,839
Suppose you've got a data frame.

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,960
It's pretty easy from the data
frame to make a plot.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,480
In fact the syntax is as simple as this.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,370
Pandas will take this data and create
a nice chart that looks about like this.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,090
It will give an individual
color to each time series and

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,310
give you a nice legend
telling you which is which.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,900
Now one problem with viewing.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,040
Data like this is for instance,
at this time, by the way,

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,490
these numbers are made up.

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,030
But it's often the case that stocks
are priced at significantly different

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,540
levels, so in this example, say,
Google had a very high price and

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,270
the other stocks had low prices, and
it's hard to look at them sort of In

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:46,620
a good way comparatively when they
have these widely variant prices.

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,520
So what we'd like to do instead is
be able say to have them all start

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,287
at one single point here,
say that's 1.0.

16
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:57,610
And then go out from there so

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,910
we can compare them on
an apples to apples comparison.

18
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:07,090
So we'd like to end up with a chart
that looks like this, where everything

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,550
starts at 1.0, and we can compare
them on an equal basis going forward.
