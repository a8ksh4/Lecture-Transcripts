00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,450
We are essentially trying to
do an inner join, that is,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,210
we only want to retain rules
common to both dataframes.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,030
Note that this is not the default,
hence, we have to mention it explicitly.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,970
So what is the default value?

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,990
What effect does it have on the result?

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,040
