00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,780
You must have noticed how we
are carrying out essentially the same

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,240
operation in different places.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,810
Why not write some utility function
that we can use going forward?

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,400
I have implemented one function for
you, symbol_to_path.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,010
It accepts a symbol name as a string and
returns the path to the corresponding

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,518
CSV file, assuming it is
stored under data by default.

7
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:32,780
For example, symbol_to_path
IBM will return data/IBM.csv.

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,750
Can you finish the implementation for
get_data?

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,000
It take a list of symbols and
dates as index and is supposed to return

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,620
a data frame with stock data for
each symbol within the given date range.

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,510
SPY is inserted into the list,

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,720
if not already present,
in order to solve as a reference.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,290
Note that you must ensure the column for
SPY does not have any nulls.

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,470
That is, the data frame should only
contain dates when SPY actually traded

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,280
in the given date range.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,700
Type in your code here.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,370
You can use test run to
execute your code and

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,950
submit to evaluate it
against our test cases.

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,820
Don't worry, there is no limit
to how many times you can try.

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,320
Good luck.
