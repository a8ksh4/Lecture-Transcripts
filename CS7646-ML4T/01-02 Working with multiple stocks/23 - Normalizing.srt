00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,510
Let's analyze the graph that we
had plotted for the four stocks.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,150
You see the four stocks
are all multiple ranges.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,970
But we need to observe
the movement of the stock.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,420
By movement I mean how
much the stock went up or

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,640
down as compared to the others.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,430
To do this, we need to normalize
the prices of all the stock.

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,640
We do this by dividing
the values of each column.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,740
By day one.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,840
This will ensure that all
the stocks will start with $1.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,190
Power of pandas and Python is
that we can do this in one line.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,800
Let's add it.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,190
We define the function: normalize data
and pass the data frame through it.

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,950
First, we want all the values
of the data frame.

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,180
Hence, we just type the name of
the data frame, which is df.

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,670
Now we want to divide all
the values of this data frame

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,470
by the first row of eight.

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,020
So we extract the first
row using row slicing.

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,310
This will give us the first row.

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,420
Now we will just divide it.

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,910
Let's see how the graph changes.

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,030
Observe, all the stocks
start with price one.

22
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,190
And now you can see the changes
that is the stock movement.

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,080
That's it for now,
I will be back soon with more coding.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,550
Until then, enjoy the power of
the Python and happy coding.
