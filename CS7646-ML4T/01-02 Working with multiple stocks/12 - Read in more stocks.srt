1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,700
So we want to read in more stocks
into a combined dataframe.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,540
Start with the code we used to build
our dataframe with the SPY data.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,090
Then define a list with
the required stock symbols.

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,370
Now we can write a for loop to read and

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,640
join each stock into
the dataframe just like SPY.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,740
So here's the for loop which takes
each symbol in the symbols list and

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,300
joins it to our main dataframe.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,930
Let's go ahead and print this.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,600
Oops.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,760
There is an error.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,140
Reading the error message carefully,

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,550
we observe that index column
Adj Close has an overlap.

13
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,280
What is happening here is that,
irrespective of the stock

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,860
the column we are extracting
each time is named Adj Close.

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,590
So the join method is confused as
to what to name it in the result.

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,050
Column names must be unique.

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,800
As professor described earlier,

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,280
we would like each stock symbol as
the corresponding column name or header.

19
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,190
So we add these two lines.

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,970
This renames the column Adj Close
to the respective stock symbol.

21
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,830
Now let's see the output.

22
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,240
Here you go,
everything is finally in place.
