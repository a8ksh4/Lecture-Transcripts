1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,660
Let's pull out the CAPM and
take a look at this portfolio.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,370
Remember for each individual stock,
the expected return is

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,100
beta times return on the market
plus alpha times the weight for

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,710
that particular stock and when we're
short, the weight is negative.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,380
And we do this across
the stocks in our portfolio.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,550
And then, that's our expected return for
the portfolio.

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,930
So, I'm going to expand this sum.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,910
First, I'm going to start
with the beta component.

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,200
So we get, weight a times beta b,

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,570
plus weight b times beta b,
times return on the market.

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,000
So recall the numbers from earlier.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,860
Our weights for A and
B were each .5 and -.5.

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,240
We got a beta of 1.0 for
A and a beta of 2.0 for B.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,390
For our alphas we had plus 1% for
stock A and -1% for stock B.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,160
We can plug all these into
our equation and work it out.

16
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:02,380
For our beta component, we end up
with a beta for the portfolio of -.5.

17
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:09,499
Our alpha component for
stock A ends up just being .5 and

18
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:14,550
for stock B, -.5 times -1 or .5.

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,161
Bringing it all together
under these assumptions,

20
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:22,723
using the CAPM, our expected return for

21
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:27,802
this allocation is -.5
times a market return + 1%.

22
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:32,080
Let's double-check this by plugging
in one of our earlier examples.

23
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,183
Consider that example where
the market went up 10%.

24
00:01:35,183 --> 00:01:38,140
So we've got -.5 times 10% + 1%.

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,802
So in the case where
the market goes up 10%,

26
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:47,130
we expect a -4% return for
our portfolio.

27
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,080
So if you step back a little bit,

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,460
remember that we arrived at
this 1% using information.

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,090
So we have some information about these
stocks that lead us to believe one would

30
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,570
go up 1% over the market, another
would go down 1% over the market.

31
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,150
On the other hand, we don't really have

32
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,540
any knowledge about what's going
to happen for the market over all.

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,758
So we have no control
over this component.

34
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:14,250
Is there some way that
we can remove this?

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,600
Can we make this part equal to 0?

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,240
If we can do that, then we essentially
remove market risk from our portfolio.

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,960
And we preserve this 1% over here.

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,080
Well, the way to do that
is to focus on this part.

39
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,690
Remember, this is beta for
the portfolio.

40
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,128
Can we make beta for the portfolio = 0?

41
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:37,060
Or in other words,
can we find weights for A and B,

42
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,050
such that their sum turns out to be 0?

43
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,235
What are these two weights so
that the overall portfolio beta is 0?
