1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,990
As an illustration of how
hedge funds use CAPM,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,240
let's consider a two stock scenario.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,230
So our hedge fund has done some research
maybe they've used machine learning,

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,110
maybe they've used some other method or
maybe they've just thought very hard and

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,750
for whatever reason
they predict that stock

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:22,340
A is going to go up 1% over
the market in the next ten days.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,739
And they've looked backwards in history
and observed that the beta for stock A,

8
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,883
with regard to the market, is 1.0.

9
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:31,624
So plus 1% beta of 1.0.

10
00:00:31,624 --> 00:00:36,361
They've looked at another stock, B,
which they predict to go down 1%

11
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:40,680
whichever way the market goes,
it'll go 1% below it.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,260
And the beta for stock B is 2.0.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,560
So this introduces for the first time
this idea of a long short portfolio.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,130
In other words, we think that stock A's
going to go up, so we should long it.

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,660
And we think stock B's going to go down,
so we should short it.

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,810
And there's some strong advantages
to this long short approach that'll

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,670
begin to emerge as we
go through this lesson.

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,160
So we're going to talk
a look at a couple scenarios

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,180
with these two stocks to see how we
should best allocate between the two.

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,310
So looking back,
this is what the S&P 500 has been doing.

21
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,500
Remember stock A has a beta of one,

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,720
so it follows what the S&P
500 does pretty closely.

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,800
Stock B, on the other hand, has this
beta of greater than one, or two.

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,270
And so it's reacting much
more wildly than stock A.

25
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,960
Here's our first scenario.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,260
Let's assume the market stays flat,
in other words it returns 0% over

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,140
these following ten days, and that we
enter our positions as of this day and

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,158
our positions are going to be
a $50 long position in stock A and

29
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:50,230
a $50 short position in stock B.

30
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,100
Now assume going forward also
that our predictions are perfect.

31
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,230
That A goes up 1% over the market and
B goes down 1% below the market.

32
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,020
What will happen?

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,035
Well, if our predictions were perfect,
stock B should go down

34
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:09,680
1% below the market, and stock
A should go up 1% above the market.

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,630
What does that mean in terms of how
much money we would see returned?

36
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,380
So if we look at stock A, and remember
we're using the CAPM, we should expect

37
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,640
to see the return for A as beta of
A times return on the market plus alpha.

38
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,980
So, the market didn't move at all so
this gets nullified so alpha for

39
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:36,325
A is one percent and we invested
$50 in that so our return is $0.50.

40
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,270
Similarly for B, this element is
removed because our return was zero and

41
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,600
all we're left with is alpha.

42
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,960
Now essentially our alpha
here was negative and

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,544
we made a negative bet,
so our return is 0.5 or

44
00:02:53,544 --> 00:02:58,520
altogether $1.0 or 1% for
our total investment.
