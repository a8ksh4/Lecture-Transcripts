00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,719
Thanks, Professor,
I'll take it from here.

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:04,850
So hello, everyone, and

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:10,090
we will be using Pandas fillna
function to fill the missing data.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:15,485
So let's find the documentation of this
function, and let's go to this site.

5
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:16,875
So here it is.

6
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,655
The link is included in
the instructor notes.

7
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:21,965
I encourage you to bookmark this site.

8
00:00:21,965 --> 00:00:27,075
So it gives the usage for any function
at a glance and it will help you a lot.

9
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:29,535
So let's scroll down and
let's search for

10
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:34,380
a function using this small search box.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,660
Let's search for fillna.

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,838
Here it is, DataFrame.fillna function,
and we'll be using this.

13
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:46,370
Read and
try to understand different options and

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,880
how to call this fillna function, and
I'll be right back with a pop quiz.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,830
So here's a question for you.

16
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:58,320
How would you call fillna() to
fill forward missing values?

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,830
Go ahead and
type your answer in this box.
