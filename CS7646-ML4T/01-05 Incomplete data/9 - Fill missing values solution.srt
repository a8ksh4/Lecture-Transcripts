1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,680
So, here's the solution.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,390
To solve this, you need to use
both forward and backward fill.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,290
The key is to use forward fill first,
and

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,330
then the backward fill, to avoid peeping
into the future as much as possible.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,170
Now let's see how the graph looks now.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,250
Here is the resulting graph.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,720
Know the effects of
the forward filling and

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,040
the backward filling in different
segments of the missing data.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,640
That's all for now.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,300
Happy quoting till I get back to you.
