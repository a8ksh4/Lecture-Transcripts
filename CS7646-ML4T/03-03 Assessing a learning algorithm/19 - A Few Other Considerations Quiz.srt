1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,380
There are a few other
factors worth considering

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,020
when evaluating a learning algorithm,
and I've tallied a few of them here.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,190
I want you to think about each one
of these and select which you think

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,370
has better performance in that regard,
linear regression or KNN.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,050
So let's step through them.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,330
How much memory do you need in
your computer to save the model?

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,580
How much compute time do you
need to train the model?

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,710
How long does it take
to query the model?

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,360
And finally, how easy is it to
add new data to your model?

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,490
So, again,
I want you to check the box according to

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,020
which one has better performance
with regard to these factors.
