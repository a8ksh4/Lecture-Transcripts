1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,350
Okay, let's start with d=1.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,360
Well, that's a linear model.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,870
That includes just this component.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,920
So of course, it must be a line,
so it's gotta be this one.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,580
That means the answer here is c.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,100
Now we have order two and
order three to choose from.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,170
Two is a parabola, so
it's including this component as well.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,670
This one's a parabola of course.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,540
And so the answer to that one is a.

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,950
And finally that leaves only b,
but let's look at why that is.

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:40,710
When we have a cubed component, we can
get this additional curl in there.

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:49,180
Now as you notice, as we increase from
order one to order two to order three,

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,490
we're gradually getting closer and
closer to tagging the actual data.

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,480
So we get to this question,

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,680
as we increase d we
are more likely to overfit.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,870
That is true.

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,330
And in fact, it can be shown
with a polynomial like this that

18
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,610
as the order of the polynomial or
d reaches in,

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,410
the total number of points, we actually
can match the data at every point.

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,820
Now a couple things to note here.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,660
One is as we go off the edge here for
all these models,

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,500
we're able to extrapolate in
the direction the data seem to be going.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,450
And this is capability
that parametric models or

24
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,270
these polynomial models
have that KNN does not.
