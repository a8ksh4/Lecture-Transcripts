1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,270
So in most cases,
in fact almost all cases,

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,693
as RMS error increases,
correlation decreases.

3
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:13,220
So this would be
a reasonably correct answer.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,250
But it is possible to
construct examples where

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,200
as RMS error increases,
correlation might increase.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,350
So that also lets you have it correct if
you checked we can't be sure either way.
