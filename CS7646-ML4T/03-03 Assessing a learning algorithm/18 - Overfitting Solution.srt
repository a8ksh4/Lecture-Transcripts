1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,770
So the answer is b.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,370
This is a little bit tricky because
the relationship for k and n and error

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,040
is a little bit different than it is for
polynomial degrees of freedom and error.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,160
Remember that as we reduce k down to
1 our in sample error approaches 0.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,430
In fact it becomes a 0
when k is equal to 1.

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,610
And similarly as we decrease k,
our other sample error decreases.

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,250
But at some point it begins to increase.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,560
This one is wrong because as we
increase k, our error increases.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,570
So this is not showing that
relationship correctly.

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,515
And this is just garbage that I threw
in there to see if anybody would bite.

11
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:48,150
[LAUGH] Now the region here in which
overfitting is occurring is here,

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,010
because remember,
as out of sample error increases, and

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,850
in sample error is decreasing,
that's where overfitting occurs
