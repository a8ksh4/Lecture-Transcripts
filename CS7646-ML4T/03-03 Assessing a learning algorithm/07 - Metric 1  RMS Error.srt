00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,490
I've shown you some graphs that suggest
the ways the models can fit the data,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,360
more or less closely.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,400
But let's have a more formal
definition of this matching.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,760
It's called error.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,230
A standard way to measure error,
is called RMS error.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,350
Let me show you how to calculate this.

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,180
Let's suppose we use this data,

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,860
which are these green points,
to build a model.

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,350
Let's say it's a linear model like this.

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,360
We can assess the model
at each real data point.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,300
For instance, at this data point.

12
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,080
And measure the difference between the Y
value of the data point, and the model.

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,130
And this difference is error.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,180
Now, we've got an error at every
single one of these data points.

15
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,850
And what we do to measure
root mean squared error,

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,400
is to take the error at each
one of these points, square it,

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,110
add them together, take the average,
and take the square root of that.

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,600
So that sounds kind of complicated,
but here's what it looks like.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,560
Ytest minus Ypredict.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,480
So Ytest are the actual
values of the data.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,900
Ypredict are what our model predicted.

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,700
We take that difference at each point.

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,160
That's this difference.

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,720
Square it, sum all those together,

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,040
divide by the number of points and
take the square root.

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,120
And that's our root mean squared error.

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,610
And what this is
an approximation of really,

28
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,080
is sort of the average error here.

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,440
But we end up emphasizing
larger errors a bit more.
