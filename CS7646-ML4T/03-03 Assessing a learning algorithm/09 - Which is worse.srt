1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,440
Suppose we're measuring the error
of a model that you built.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,870
Which sort of error would
you expect to be larger?

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,820
In sample error,

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,340
in which we measure the accuracy of our
model against the set it was trained on?

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,260
Or out of sample error,
where we measure the error of the model

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,440
against a new test set that
it hasn't seen before?

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,430
Which is worse?
