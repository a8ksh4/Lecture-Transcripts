1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,890
So, in terms of space for

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,110
saving the model, linear
regression is a hands down winner.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,230
For instance, if we're learning
a third order polynomial,

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,330
we have to only store four numbers.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,470
KNN, on the other hand,
requires you to keep all the data, so

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,760
it could be megabytes or
gigabytes of data.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,600
So, KNN is bad in this regard.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,880
Compute time to train.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,570
KNN is much better in this case.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,420
In fact,
it takes zero time to train KNN.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,890
You just stuff the model into
a data store and you're done.

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,170
On the other hand, linear regression
has to take all that data,

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,980
compute over it,
to find those parameters.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,880
Compute time to query.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,200
LinReg wins hands down.

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,740
All you do is you plug your X in,
multiply it out and that's the answer.

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,350
KNN requires quite a bit of time
to query because you have to,

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,220
among other things,
usually do a sort to cross all the data.

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,190
Ease to add new data.

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,970
KNN wins that because all you
gotta do is just plop it in there,

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,470
you don't have to do any re-calculation.

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,470
With linear regression,
you have to add the new data and

23
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,480
then recompute the factors.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,210
Well, that's all for
how to assess learning algorithms.

25
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,320
I will see you again soon.

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,820
Thank you.
