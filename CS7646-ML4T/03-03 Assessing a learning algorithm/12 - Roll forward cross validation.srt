00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,730
Cross validation is a great tool, but

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,850
the typical usage of it doesn't fit
financial data applications well.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,200
The reason is that it can
permit peeking into the future.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,440
So for instance, if our training
data is after our test data

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,560
that means we're seeing
the future ahead of our test.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,230
Any sort of peeking like this can read
to unrealistically optimistic results,

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,870
so with this sort of
data we need to avoid it.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,440
One way to avoid this problem is
with role forward cross validation.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,950
That means our training data is
always before our testing data.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,100
But we can still have multiple trials
just by rolling our data forward,

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,522
like this and this and this,
till we run out of data.
