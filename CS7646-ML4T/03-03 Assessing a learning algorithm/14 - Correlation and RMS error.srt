00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,800
I want you to think now about
the relationship between RMS error and

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,950
correlation.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,090
And in particular, I'm talking
about correlation between our

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,340
predicted result and the actual result.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,470
Do you think that as RMS error
increases, correlation would decrease,

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,820
correlation would increase,
or we can't really be sure?
