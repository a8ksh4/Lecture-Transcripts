00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:06,529
Assume we're using a rolling mean, and
we're tracking the price here in blue.

2
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:11,054
And we're looking for an opportunity
to find when the prices diverged

3
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:16,040
significantly far from the rolling mean
that it might be an opportunity for,

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,358
say, a buy signal or a sell signal.

5
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:22,455
How can we decide that we’re far enough
away from the mean that we should

6
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,305
consider something like that?

7
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:30,520
So the question is, which statistic
might we use to discover this?

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,970
Here are a few options.

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,400
Give it some thought, and check the box
you think makes the most sense.
