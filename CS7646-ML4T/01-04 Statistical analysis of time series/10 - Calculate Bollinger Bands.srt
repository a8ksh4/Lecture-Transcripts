1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,780
Note how we calculated the rolling mean.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,050
The rolling standard deviation can
be computed in a very similar way.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,520
Pandas provide a function called
rolling_std to do this job.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,093
We simply pass in the values and
the window size.

5
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:19,392
Now, onto Bollinger bands.

6
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:24,477
Recall that upper bound is two standard
deviation above the rolling mean.

7
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:26,613
Let's type this in our code.

8
00:00:26,613 --> 00:00:31,265
Here, we add 2 times the value of
the rolling standard deviation to

9
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,580
the rolling mean.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,388
Though the mean and the standard
deviation values are in the form of

11
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:38,641
CD's, the mathematics still works.

12
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:42,273
It is similar to the arithmetic
operation on numpy arrays,

13
00:00:42,273 --> 00:00:44,197
which is done element-wise.

14
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:48,220
Next, let's calculate
lower_band in a similar way.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,730
Here, I subtracted 2 times the rolling
standard deviation values from

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,220
the rolling mean.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,760
Note that will return the values for
the two bands together.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,807
These are received back when
the function is called.

19
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:04,545
Let's see if a function computes
Bollinger bands correctly.

20
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:06,280
Looks good to me.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,150
Observe the selling and
the buying points.

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,090
You can play with the window size and
see how the bands change.

23
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,380
You could also try computing
bands at different deviation

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,480
away from the rolling mean.
