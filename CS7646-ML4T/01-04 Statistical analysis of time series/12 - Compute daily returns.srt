1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,110
Ta da!

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,020
It's quiz time again.

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,700
Can you write a function to
compute daily return values?

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,550
It should take a data frame as input.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,860
Apply the formula to
calculate daily returns.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,510
Use proper slicing and indexing to
avoid having to loop over each value.

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,700
Note that the return data frame must
contain the same column labels and

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,590
the same number of rows
as the given data frame.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,430
Which means if there are any missing or
unknown values, replace them with zero.
