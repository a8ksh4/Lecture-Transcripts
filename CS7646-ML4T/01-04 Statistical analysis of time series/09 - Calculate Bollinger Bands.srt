00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,800
It's quiz time.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,750
Professor explained to you how
to get Bollinger Bands and

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,660
now you get to try it yourself.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,637
Here's the data frame containing
the stock prices for SPY for year 2012.

5
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:18,080
Now computing Bollinger Bands
consists of three main steps.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,890
First, compute rolling mean followed by
computing rolling standard deviation.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,860
And then, finally, computing the values
for the upper and the lower bands.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,560
We want you to implement
one function for each step.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,950
You can call each
function in this manner.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,690
Note that in this case,

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,050
we use a window size of 20 for
calculating rolling statistics.

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,780
But we should be able to vary this.

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,670
Finally, we plot the original prices,
rolling mean, and the Bollinger Bands.

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,830
Let me start you out with
one of the functions.

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,730
Here is how I would
implement get_rolling_mean.

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,960
Now go ahead and write code to compute
the rolling standard deviation and

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,540
calculate the upper and
the lower Bollinger Bands.

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,600
Wondering how to compute
rolling standard deviation?

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,780
Check out the trusty panels
documentation for that.

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,700
Now refer back to the previous
video if you forgot how to

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,140
calculate Bollinger Bands.
