00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,770
Now we're going to look at
something called Daily Returns.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,570
Daily returns are one of the most
important statistics used in

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,850
financial analysis.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:16,423
So let's consider first here this
time series, S&P 500 in 2012.

5
00:00:16,423 --> 00:00:21,152
What daily returns are is simply
how much did the price go up or

6
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:23,580
down on a particular day?

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,180
So, for instance,
on this day it went down a little.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,960
On the next day it went up a lot.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,290
Daily returns are calculated easily
using a simple equation here.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,420
So the daily return for
day t, let's say today,

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:48,740
is simply today's stock price divided
by yesterdays' stock price, minus one.

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,365
Let me show you an example.

13
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:54,936
Let's suppose on this particular
day the price went from $100

14
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:57,071
yesterday to $110 today.

15
00:00:57,071 --> 00:01:01,519
The daily return then, for that day,

16
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,412
is (110/100)- 1, or

17
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:10,510
1.1- 1 = .1, which is 10%.

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,860
So that's how we
calculate daily returns.

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,540
Now one thing to remember is this is a
kind of statement you might put in a for

20
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,480
loop where you iterate
over individual days.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,620
Don't do that.

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,160
Use the NumPy syntax we showed you,

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,730
where you can do this in a single
statement with no for loops.

24
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,760
Here's what a chart for
daily returns might look like.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,260
Everything is scaled now
from minus 10% to plus 10%.

26
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,310
And what we see here is
the daily return for each day.

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,070
If it was a positive return,
of course it's positive, and

28
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,940
negative if it were negative.

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,740
Remember the day when we calculated
we had a positive return of 10% that

30
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,380
corresponds to that point right here.

31
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,760
And for instance, here on the next
day we had negative daily return.

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,850
That corresponds to
that point right here.

33
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,810
Key thing to remember here is this
is a line that sort of zigs and

34
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,508
zags, usually close to zero.

35
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:15,020
And if you were to, say,
take the mean of all these

36
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,260
values because we've had a generally
upward moving trend here,

37
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,390
our mean would probably be
a little bit positive, above zero.

38
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,630
Where looking at daily returns can
be really important and revealing

39
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,860
is to compare daily returns between
different stocks or different assets.

40
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,266
So, for example we might compare how
Exxon moves in comparison to S&P 500.

41
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:42,409
As one example,

42
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:47,800
if you take a look at this section here
you can see that when S&P 500 went up,

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,630
Exxon went down and that's revealed here
in this section of the daily returns.

44
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,080
We're going to spend a lot of
time in some future lessons,

45
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,590
looking at how these statistics,

46
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,460
specifically how daily returns between
different assets, can be revealing.

47
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,530
Dave is going to show you now in Python,

48
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,000
how to calculate these
daily return values.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,730
Here's to you, Dave.
