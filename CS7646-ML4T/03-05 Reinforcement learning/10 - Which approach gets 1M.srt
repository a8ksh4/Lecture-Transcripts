1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,050
So there are actually
several that satisfy that.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,760
Infinite horizon is a little bit iffy
because the robot can go this way and

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,420
get a dollar on every other move and
that will add up to infinity.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,800
It can go here and get the $1 million
and then come back and do that and

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,000
it will add up to infinity.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,090
So it's possible that infinite
horizon will cause it to do that but

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,986
there's two equivalent solutions.

8
00:00:21,986 --> 00:00:28,990
Finite with n=4,
no it won't get to that $1 million.

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,330
Because if it tries to go that way,
it'll only get negative reward here, but

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,690
it'll get positive reward
if it goes that way.

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,760
However, if we let n go out to 10,
boom, it'll reach that $1 million.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,925
And finally, discounted reward, where
each dollar in the future is only worth

13
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:53,120
0.95, and that gets smaller as we get
further and further into the future.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,370
Still, by the time we get to the eight
steps that it takes to reach this

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,610
reward It's still so huge that that's
clearly the optimal thing to do.

16
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,120
Okay, so

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,030
those are the answers to which horizons
will cause us to get to that $1 million.
