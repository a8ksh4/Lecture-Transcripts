00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,402
A common practice in finance
is to plot histograms of daily

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:09,091
returns of different stocks together and
look at them together and

3
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,870
assess how they relate to one another.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:18,400
So here, we've got a plot of
an XYZ stock and SPY or S&P 500.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,120
Now take a look and see what
difference you can see between them.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,843
Now to help out, I'll draw what
the underlying shape is looking like.

7
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:31,700
Check which answer you think
is most correct in terms of

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,510
volatility and return for
XYZ versus SPY.
