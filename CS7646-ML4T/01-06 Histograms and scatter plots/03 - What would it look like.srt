00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,240
Suppose now that we've looked at,
say the S&P 500 over many years and

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,570
we've measured each day what
the daily return is for the S&P 500.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,410
And we conduct a histogram and
plot that histogram.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,050
So, for
each little bin we have a bar there.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,570
What is the shape of this
histogram going to look like?

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,690
Do you think the bars, when we put them
all together, will have a sort of flat

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:33,260
shape, maybe a triangular shape, or
something that's more like a bell curve?

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,450
Check the box next to the histogram
that you think is the best answer.
