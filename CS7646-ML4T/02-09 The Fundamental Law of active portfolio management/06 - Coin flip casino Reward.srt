1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,200
To figure out which of
these scenarios is best,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,850
we need to consider reward and risk.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,600
Let's start here first with reward.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,240
So when we talk about
reward in this situation,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,600
we're talking about our expected return.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,750
So in the single bet case,
we bet 1000 chips at once.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:24,940
Our expected return is the chance that
we'll win the bet times the return

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,950
we get plus the chance that we would
lose the bet times what we would lose.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,030
So, the chance that we're
going to win is 0.51.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,510
Remember, it's a biased coin.

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,410
And we have the opportunity
to win 1000 tokens or $1000.

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,692
The chance that we'll lose is 0.49 or
49%.

13
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:48,990
And if we lose, we would lose a $1,000.

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,580
So if you multiply this all out and

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,579
add it up, you end up seeing
that our expected return is $20.

16
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:00,150
I'd like for you now to figure
out what's our expected return or

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,230
what's the reward in the multibet case

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,360
where we bet 1000 individual
chips on 1000 different tables.

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,390
And all those coins are flipped at once.

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,130
All biased coins with a 51%
chance of winning for us.

21
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,960
What's our expected return in that case?
