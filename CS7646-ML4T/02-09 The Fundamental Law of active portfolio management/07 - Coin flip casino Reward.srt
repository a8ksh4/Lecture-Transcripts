1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,010
So, we make a bunch of individual bets,

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,689
each one has the same chances as this
one up here, except each one of those

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:12,620
individual bets only provides
a loss of $1 or a gain of $1.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,551
So, each of our individual bets has
this 0.51 chance of winning $1,

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,980
and 0.49 chance of losing $1.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,930
And we just have a thousand of those.

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,221
So if you work out the numbers it turns
out that this works out to be 0.02,

8
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:32,700
and we multiply it by a thousand and
we get $20.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,350
So what's remarkable, or
at least interesting, is that for

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,200
both of these ways of betting,
our expected return is exactly the same.

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,070
So the reward side of this determining
which is better, is showing us

12
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,840
that it's the same, so why should I say
that this multibet approach is better?

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,580
Well, it turns out that that's all about
the risk, so let's look at the risk now.
