00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,330
Let's get back to that original
question that motivated some of this,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,920
which is how can we relate the
performance of Renaissance technologies?

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,580
Or Jim Simons versus Warren Buffet?

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,302
And the quiz here is for

5
00:00:13,302 --> 00:00:17,990
you to use the fundamental law to
see if you can relate the two.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,562
Okay, so for this problem,
assume that both Simons and

7
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,930
Buffet have the same information ratio.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,780
I'm making that up,
I don't know for sure that they do.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,870
But this is just a simplification for
this problem.

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:36,330
Assume that Simons' algorithms are only
one 1000th as smart as Buffet.

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,114
So that's another way of
saying that their information

12
00:00:40,114 --> 00:00:43,670
coefficient is one 1000th
the value of Buffet.

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,500
Also assume that Buffet
trades 120 times per year.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,860
Given that, how many trades
must Simons execute in order

15
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,640
to maintain the information ratio
at the same level as Buffet?
