1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,150
To get the maximum value in a given 1D
array, you could loop through the array,

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,310
finding the maximum and
keeping track of an index.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,960
But numpy can help you do
this in a single call.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,970
You must have seen argmax and

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,760
argmin used to described
optimization equations.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,300
This is the same idea.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,488
Let's check the output.

8
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:26,920
So the function returned us the maximum
value, along with the index.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,710
Now for multidimensional arrays,
finding and

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,870
representing indices is a little tricky.

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,789
But numpy provides some
utility functions like

12
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,212
underscore index to help you out.
