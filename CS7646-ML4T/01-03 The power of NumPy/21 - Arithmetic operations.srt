1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,830
Arithmetic operations on arrays
are always applied element wise.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,170
Let's start with simple
multiplication operation.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,880
Here we define a simple array so
that we can easily track the changes.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,780
This will multiply each element by 2.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,250
Let's check the output.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,680
When using arithmetic operation,
a new array is created and

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,960
the values are stored in that array.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,220
So our original array a still
holds the same values.

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,570
And this is our new array which we
get after multiplying array a by two.

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,780
Observe that,
it is element wise multiplication.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,550
Let's try division.

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,610
Here we use the division operation to
divide each element of array a by two.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,510
Let's check the output.

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,043
Observe that, when you divide 1 by 2,

15
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:51,980
you get a value 0 over
here instead of 0.5.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,070
This is because both the array and
the divisor are integers.

17
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,430
If we were to do 2.0 instead of 2,
you will get float values.

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,070
Keep this point in mind before
performing division in general.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,780
That is int divided by int will
give you an integer output.

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,050
To get float values,
you need at least, the numerator or

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,780
the denominator to be a float value.

22
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,750
Let's check the output.

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,580
Observe that, we could successfully get
a floating point value instead of 0.

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,670
How about arithmetic
operation using two arrays?

25
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,700
We will start with addition.

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,130
We create another array
b with these values.

27
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,590
Now, let's just add a and
b using the plus operator.

28
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,460
As mentioned, this is element wise.

29
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,838
This is our new arraya plus b.

30
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:46,900
One important thing to note
here is that the shape of a and

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:53,080
b should be similar before the operation
a plus b, else it will throw error.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,670
Similar to the addition,
you can perform subtraction.

33
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,800
Now, let's move ahead with
multiplying two arrays.

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,540
This is interesting, because unlike
other many metrics languages

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,290
multiplication operator
when used with two array

36
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,240
will not give you metric product, but
will do element wise multiplication.

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,740
That is,
element at position 0,0 in array

38
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,381
a is multiplied only with
the element at position 0,0 in b.

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,540
Let's print the multiplication
of matrix a and b.

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,640
Can you also element
wise multiplication?

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,790
But the next question would be,
what about matrix multiplication?

42
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,240
How do you achieve that?

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,710
Like, for everything,
Num Pi has a function.

44
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,790
It has function called dot,
which performs matrix multiplication.

45
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,480
Similar to multiplication,
division of two arrays can be performed.

46
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,300
Just include division of
operators between the two arrays.

47
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,360
Let's check the output.

48
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,150
As seen before, since array a and

49
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,680
b are indigenous, we get the final array
in the form of indigenous as well.

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,530
If you want to see floating values,
convert one of the arrays to float.

51
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,140
Well, that's all for now.

52
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,890
Keep practicing.
