00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,230
Next you will see how to perform various
mathematical operations on np arrays.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,450
Let's use a random heading of integers.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,110
Let's create an array with shape
five rows and four columns.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,860
Let's see the output.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,850
So here's an array with five rows,
four columns, and

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,370
all the values between the range 0 and
10.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,200
Note how we used seed, the random
number generator with the constant,

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,210
to get the same sequence
of numbers every time.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,330
Let's run again and
see if the output remains the same.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,540
You can see that we have
the same values for the array.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,290
Summing all the elements in an array
is as simple as calling the function

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,370
sum on the array.

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,555
Here is our array a, and
we call the sum function on it.

14
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's check the output.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,600
This is our array and

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,210
this is sum of all the elements present
in the array, which comes out to be 79.

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,840
We can also sum in a specific
direction of the array.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,320
What I mean by direction
is along rows or columns.

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,010
NumPy gives this
direction a special name.

20
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,700
It is called access.

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,760
Access is equal to zero,
signifies rows, and

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,950
access is equal to one
indicates columns.

23
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,720
Remember this terminology as
you will use it frequently.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,160
Let's code to make things clear.

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,470
Passing the parameter, axis,

26
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,830
along with a specific value will
give you the sum along that axis.

27
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,320
To understand this,
let's first see the output.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,530
To get the sum of each column, we pass
the value to the axis attribute as zero.

29
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,647
And to get the sum of the rows,
we pass the value as one.

30
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:48,653
To understand this imagine if you wanted
to sum the values of each column,

31
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:51,080
what would you iterate on?

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,500
You would say something like,

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,040
For each column, sum all the values
of each row of that column.

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,100
So you would essentially
iterate over the rows.

35
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:08,370
Hence we pass axis=0 to compute column
sums and similarly axis=1 for row sums.

36
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:15,000
Observe the output when we pass axis=0,
we get four values.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,660
These are basically
the sum of each columns.

38
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,680
And when we passed axis=1.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,570
We get five values which
are the sum of each row.

40
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,810
Let's go ahead and try some basic
operation like finding minimum,

41
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,870
maximum, and mean of an array.

42
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,160
So, if I want minimum along columns,
I have to go through each row

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,430
of each column, so axis equal to zero
to get the minimum of each column.

44
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,520
To get the maximum of each row,
similarly we call a max function and

45
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,288
pass access equal to one.

46
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:52,920
Just calling a.mean,

47
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,220
that is array dot mean, will give
us the mean of the entire array.

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,770
Of course we can get mean along each
axis as we did for max and min.

49
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,320
Observe the output.

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,430
Minimum of the first column is one,
which is shown over here.

51
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,536
This value is essentially,
minimum of the first column.

52
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:17,560
This is of second, this is of third,
and this is of fourth.

53
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,070
Similarly, for maximum of the each row,
you can observe that for

54
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,670
the first row, the maximum is five,
and it is shown here.

55
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,530
The mean of all
the elements is 3.95 which

56
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,070
is calculated using the mean function.

57
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,470
There are many more functions
which you can experiment with.

58
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,020
