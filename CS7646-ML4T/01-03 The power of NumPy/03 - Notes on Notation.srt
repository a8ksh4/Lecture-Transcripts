1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,680
Consider an nd array, nd1.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,520
I'm going to show you now how
to access cells within that.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,880
Now, the notation, at first,
might seem sort of familiar, but

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,170
there's some new and different things
that you probably haven't seen before.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,450
So the usual syntax is
the name of your nd array,

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,490
bracket, the row and the column.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,410
So again, these are our rows.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,160
So row indicates which row we're using.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,750
Column, which column.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:32,380
It's important to know that in NumPy,
our columns and rows begin at 0.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,038
So this element is nd1[0,0].

12
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:41,838
It then continues of course,
1, 2, 3, 4 in the rows, and

13
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:45,390
in the columns, 0, 1, 2, 3.

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,180
Before I tell you, see if you can
guess how to address this cell.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,368
The answer is that
this cell is nd1 [3,2],

16
00:00:56,368 --> 00:01:00,214
0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2.

17
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:03,290
Now, this is probably the kind
of stuff you've seen before.

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,810
It turns out, though,
that the NumPy is much more powerful and

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,680
can do interesting and
different kinds of slicing.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,480
What if, for instance,

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,800
you wanted to address this
sub portion of the nd array?

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,587
How could you indicate that?

23
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:23,140
NumPy uses a special symbol,
the colon, to let you indicate ranges.

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,012
So we can indicate this
range in rows with 0:3,

25
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:34,630
which indicates the zeroth to the,
just before the third row.

26
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,869
And in the columns, we've got 01:3.

27
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:44,099
So this syntax indicates starting
at the zeroth row to just

28
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:50,320
before the third and the first
column to just before the third.

29
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,810
And in fact, captures this region.

30
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,560
The key thing to remember here
that's a little bit tricky is that

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,690
this last value is one past the one
that you actually want to include.

32
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:10,130
So, for instance, this is column 3,
but it's not included.

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,080
Now, if we just use the colon by
itself that indicates, for instance,

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,340
if we place it in the rows position,
that we want all of the rows.

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,370
So you don't have to use the colon
just to indicate a range.

36
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,480
You can use it by itself for
all of them.

37
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,480
Now, look at this statement,
see if you can figure out

38
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,890
which part of this nd array it
refers to before I show you.

39
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,500
It is this region right here.

40
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,218
So it's all the rows and
column 3, 0, 1, 2, 3.

41
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:44,280
So it's this section right here.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,850
NumPy includes some
special syntax that lets

43
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,270
you refer to the last row or column.

44
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,877
So, for instance, the last row here,
you can indicate with

45
00:02:54,877 --> 00:03:00,040
negative 1,
second to last row would be negative 2.

46
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,540
So if we wanted to refer
to these 2 cells here,

47
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,550
we would take advantage of
this negative 1 syntax.

48
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,380
So a negative 1 indicates that last row.

49
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,740
And then to get these 2 columns,
we would use 1:3.

50
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,460
0, 1, 2, and
then we don't include the last 1 there.

51
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,400
There is a bunch of new syntax.

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,320
I hope that you find it exciting.

53
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,360
This is really one of the most
powerful aspects of Python and NumPy.

54
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,660
And it really enables you to
do some interesting things.

55
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,450
Now, we've got a quiz to see if you
can figure out how to use this new

56
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,280
syntax yourself.
