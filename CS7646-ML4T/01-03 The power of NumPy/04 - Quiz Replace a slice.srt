00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,410
Now we've shown you how to
address slices of ND arrays.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,029
We're going to give you a little quiz
to see if you can figure something out.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,808
Suppose we have these two ND arrays,
nd1 and nd2.

4
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:15,340
And we want to replace
some of the values in nd1,

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,950
with these values from nd2.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,750
Here are four alternatives, see which
one you think makes the most sense.
