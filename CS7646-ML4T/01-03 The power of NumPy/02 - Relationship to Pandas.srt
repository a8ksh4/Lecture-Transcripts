1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,150
Now, how does NumPy relate to Pandas?

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,600
Well, I said just a moment ago that
NumPy is a wrapper for numerical

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,710
libraries, well it turns out that
Pandas is a kind of wrapper for NumPy.

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,090
So remember our traditional data frame
here, with our columns being symbols and

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,660
our rows being dates.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,800
This data frame is just
a wrapper around this ndarray,

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,730
access the columns with symbols and
the rows by dates.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,337
But you can, in fact, just treat this
inside part as an ndarray directly.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,976
If you use this syntax in Python,
that pulls these values out and

10
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:46,014
lets you access it directly and
then ndarray.

11
00:00:46,014 --> 00:00:50,299
You don't really need to do that though,
you can,

12
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:55,200
if you like, treat a data frame
just like a NumPy ndarray.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,760
And so we're going to assume
in the rest of this lesson

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,310
that we're just working with an ndarray.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,300
And like I said, you can use all of
these mechanisms that we're going to

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,100
show you with ndarrays and
with data frames directly.

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,890
What you get if you create something
as a data frame, as we'll see in

18
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,786
a lesson a little bit later,
you get many, many, many more routines.

19
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,540
And you can treat it, like I said,
just like an ndarray but

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,980
you get a vast new number of
statistical functions and so on.
