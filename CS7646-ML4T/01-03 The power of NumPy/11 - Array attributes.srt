1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,350
Any numpy array has a number of
attributes that describes it.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,730
In addition to the elements it contains.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,110
One of the most useful one is shape.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,520
Essentially a tuple containing
the number of rows and

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,340
columns are height and
width of the array.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,480
We have already seen how to
specify this when creating arrays.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,410
The shape of the array A would
be five rows and four columns.

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,790
So this is your array.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,850
Now let's see how to access
the shape of the given array

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,430
by using the shape attribute.

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,686
a.shape will give you
the shape of the array.

12
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:35,607
Let's run it.

13
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:40,365
Array.shape will return you a tuple
with the first value specifying

14
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:42,620
the number of rows.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,950
And the second value specifying
the number of columns.

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,410
Next we will learn how to
individually access number of rows or

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,425
number of columns.

18
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:54,865
a.shape[0] would return
the number of rows and

19
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:57,890
a.shape[1] would return
the number of columns.

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,750
Let's check the output.

21
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,720
Here you will see that the number of
rows are correctly extracted as five.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,590
And number of columns as 4.

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,450
If you have more dimensions,

24
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,380
you will have additional
elements in the shape tuple.

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,370
The number of dimensions in an array
can be found by simply asking for

26
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,545
the length of this tuple.

27
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:18,720
a.shape will return a tuple and

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,570
the length of that tuple would inform
us what is the dimension of the array.

29
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,160
It rightly tells us that the dimension
of the defined array A is 2.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,050
Okay, how about total number
of elements in an array?

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,650
Yes for a 2D array, it will be the
product of number of rows and columns.

32
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,170
But if you had more dimension,

33
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,680
this calculation could
be a little complicated.

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,690
Fortunately we can retrieve
the number of elements directly using

35
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,805
size attributes.

36
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:51,900
a.size will give us the number of
elements present in the array A.

37
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,920
We can expect the output to be
the product of the rows and

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,460
the columns which is 5 into 4,
which is 20.

39
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,480
Let's check it.

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,480
As we expected, the output is 20 which
means there are 20 values in the array.

41
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,380
Attributes like size and shape
are very useful when you have to over

42
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,360
array elements to perform
some computation.

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,000
You can also access the data
type of each element using

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,875
the D type attribute of the array.

45
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:24,790
Let's check the data type of
the values present in array A.

46
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,480
In this case, our array elements
are of the type float64.

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,250
That is 64-bit floating point numbers.
