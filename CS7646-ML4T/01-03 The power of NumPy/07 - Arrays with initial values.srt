1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,910
NumPy also offers several function to
create empty arrays with initial values.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,550
For certain computations these help
avoid growing arrays incrementally

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,990
which can be an expensive operation.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,560
Let's start with
creating an empty array.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,540
The empty function takes
the shape of the array as input.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,770
The shape can be defined as a single
integer, as we did over here, for

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,400
creating a one dimensional array, or

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,440
a sequence of integers denoting
the size in each dimension.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,110
For a two dimensional array,
a sequence of two integers is needed.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,910
That is the number of rows and
the number of columns.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,600
For this example, we will create
an empty array with five rows and

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,530
four columns.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,180
Passing in a tuple with values 5 and 4.

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,890
So here I pass a tuple with values 5 and
4.

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,570
In case you need a three
dimensional array, or any

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,260
greater number of dimensions, you can
just add another number to the sequence.

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,272
This will give you a 3 dimensional
array with a depth of 3, and

18
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:03,510
each depth having 5 rows and 4 columns.

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,840
For this lesson we will only work
with two dimensional arrays.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,030
Now let's check the output.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,960
Hm, strange.

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,280
The empty array is not actually empty.

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,600
What happens is that when we call
numpy.empty to create an array,

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,340
the elements of the array
read in whatever

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,890
values were present in
the corresponding memory location.

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,890
These are effectively
random values that depend

27
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,040
on the state of the computer's memory.

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,610
Also observe that by default
the elements are the floating points.

29
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,240
Next we create an array full of ones.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,360
Like the empty function,
we pass in the number of rows and

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,560
columns as a sequence.

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,020
To create an array full of ones,
you call the one function and

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,420
pass the sequence, which has number
of rows and number of columns.

34
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,930
You can expect this time to
have an array of 5 rows and

35
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,980
4 columns with all
the values equal to 1.

36
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,120
Let's go ahead and check this.

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,060
Here it is.

38
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,415
An array with 5 rows, 4 columns, and
all the values of the array equal to 1.
