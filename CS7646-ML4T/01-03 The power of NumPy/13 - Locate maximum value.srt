00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,380
So far we have seen how to
compute certain measures.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,010
How about finding the position
of some element in an array?

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,620
Can you implement this simple function
to find the index of the maximum value

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,570
in the one-dimensional array.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,090
Remember NumPy is your friend.
