00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,768
Fortunately, you can change
this when creating the array.

00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:12,995
What parameter do you need to
add to this function to create

00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:15,247
an array of integers instead?

5
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:17,159
Type the name of the parameter and

6
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:20,400
the correct value in
the corresponding boxes.

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,900
Documentation for the array.ones
