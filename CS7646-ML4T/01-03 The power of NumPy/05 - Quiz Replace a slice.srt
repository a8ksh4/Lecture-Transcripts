1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,810
Of these four,
this one is the right answer.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,280
Here's why.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,270
This is the only left-hand side that
singles out these correct rows,

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,470
starting at zero, and ending at one.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:17,030
And these correct columns, again
starting at zero and ending at one.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,960
If you look at the right hand side,

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,579
here is a little bit of new syntax
that you hadn't seen before.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,680
We indicate the rows
second from last by a -2.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,930
So that's what that -2 means.

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,540
And a colon with nothing after it
means go all the way to the end.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,259
So we've singled out these rows and
this indicates these two columns.

12
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,260
So that's why this one
is the correct answer.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,050
Now, I'm going to hand it over to Dev,
and

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,960
she is going to show you how to do all
these things directly in Python syntax.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,674
Here's to you Dev.
