1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,880
We're finally able now to get to
the core of the capital assets pricing

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,350
model, and that's expressed in this
single equation that's really important.

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,220
You need to memorize it and
understand it.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,460
And here's what that equation is.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,510
So the capital assets pricing
model says that the return for

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:30,290
an individual stock on a particular day
t = beta times the return on the market.

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,270
So, I told you just a moment ago,
for instance, that the, when we say

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,440
the market in the United States,
we're usually referring to the S&P 500.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,457
And this particular stock, i,
is one of the stocks in the S&P 500.

10
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:50,511
So its return on a particular day,
again, is beta times the return

11
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:56,900
on the market of that day + alpha of
that particular stock on that day.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,580
So what the capital assets pricing model
is asserting, and this is important,

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,770
is that a significant
portion of the return for

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,650
a particular stock is due to the market.

15
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,230
In other words, the market moving up or

16
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,395
down strongly affects the change in
price on every individual stock.

17
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:19,770
And the extent to which the market
affects a particular stock

18
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,280
is encapsulated in this beta which
we'll talk about in just a second.

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,270
But every stock has its individual beta
that specifies how much it's affected.

20
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,360
Many stocks have a beta near one which
means when the market goes up or

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,510
down 1%, that stock goes up or down 1%.

22
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:44,117
But if you had say a larger beta, say
two, that means if the market goes up 1%

23
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:49,138
we would expect, all else being equal,
that the stock goes up 2%.

24
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:53,170
This other component, alpha,
is called the residual.

25
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,628
So of course, if you look at
all the stocks over one day and

26
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:59,437
look at how much the market goes up or
down, and

27
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:04,216
you calculate how much the stock should
have gone up or down according to beta.

28
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:05,412
Well there'll be something left over.

29
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:08,070
It won't exactly match
what beta predicted.

30
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,990
And that's what this alpha or
residual component is.

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,413
An important part of
the capital assets pricing

32
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:22,630
model is that the expectation for
alpha is 0.

33
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,710
Essentially this is a random variable
with an expected value of 0.

34
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,100
It's important to remember that.

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,250
Where do we get this beta and
this alpha?

36
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:39,020
Well, it comes from daily returns and
essentially how the daily returns for

37
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,080
a particular stock relate to
the daily returns of the market.

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,187
So look at returns here for S&P 500, and

39
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:53,190
consider the S&P 500 in comparison
to this other stock xyz.

40
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,540
So xyz, its daily returns
are shown here in green.

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,689
And blue shows S&P 500.

42
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:05,250
Now look at each day, seems that
the xyz stock is more reactive.

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,070
In other words, if S&P 500 goes up
a little, this stock goes up more.

44
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,960
And, on average, it tends to
have a higher return each day.

45
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,000
We can look at what happens with
the returns on each day and

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,020
plot them over here in a scatter plot.

47
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,960
So on this particular day,
the market went up a little bit, and

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,520
xyz went up a little bit more.

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,968
So that would correspond to
a point right about there.

50
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:33,872
Now, if we plotted the results for a lot
of these days, we would get a scatter

51
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:37,665
plot that looks a bit like this,
where each green dot represents one day.

52
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:40,720
And if we fit a line to it, we'd get
something that looks about like this.

53
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:47,270
So beta is simply
the slope of this line, and

54
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:53,520
alpha is simply this area here, in other
words, the y-intercept of that line.

55
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,980
Now this is an after
the fact of calculation.

56
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,230
In other words, just because
historically a particular stock,

57
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,890
looking back at time gave
you a particular alpha,

58
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,080
you shouldn't necessarily
expect that in the future.

59
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,690
And again, CAPM says that you
should expect this to be 0.

60
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,660
In reality though, it's not always 0.

61
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,050
So, that's the key to the capital
assets pricing model and where beta and

62
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,890
alpha come from.
