00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,840
Before we launch into details of
the capital assets pricing model,

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,090
we have to lay down
a little bit of groundwork.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,420
Let's start with
the definition of a portfolio.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,400
A portfolio is a weighted set of assets.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
So as an example, let's suppose
you've got a portfolio that's got

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,430
three different assets in it,
Apple, Google, and Oracle.

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,400
And if you look at the entire value
of your portfolio, let's suppose that

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,030
60% of it is in Apple,
20% is in Google, and 20% is in Oracle.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,932
If we consider this as a set of weights,
that means we've got

10
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:42,440
0.6 in Apple, 0.2 in Google and
0.3 in oracle.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,160
So, the first part of our
definition of a portfolio

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,830
is that w sub i is the proportion
of funds that are an asset i.

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,840
We require that the sum of all
these w sub i is equal to 1,

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,510
in other words they add up to 100%.

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,990
Now sometimes, for leveraged
portfolios that we're not going to

16
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,700
cover in this class,
this number might be greater than one.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,060
But skip that for now.

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,070
We do allow that you
might short some stocks.

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,160
So for instance,
let's suppose you shorted Google.

20
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,610
Your allocation there would be,
minus point two.

21
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,920
So, let's refine this
equation a little bit and

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,740
require that the sum of the absolute
value of the weights is equal to one.

23
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,610
So, some of them might be short,
some of them might be long.

24
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,565
But, if you add up the absolute value
their weights will require that to be

25
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,980
1.0.

26
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,970
So now that we've defined what
a portfolio is, let's think for

27
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,970
a moment about what will the returns
on a portfolio look like.

28
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,420
So, it's a simple equation, really.

29
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,940
It's the sum for
each asset of the weight of

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,600
that asset in the portfolio, times
the return for that day, of the asset.

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,250
We just add all those up,
one by one, and boom,

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,390
that's the return on the portfolio for
that day.
