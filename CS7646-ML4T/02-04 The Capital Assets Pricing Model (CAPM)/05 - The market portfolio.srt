1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,930
So a concept that's important to
the capital assets pricing model

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,540
is this thing called
The Market Portfolio.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,300
Now what is that exactly?

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,680
When someone refers to the Market
what they're usually referring to is

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,840
an index that broadly covers
a large set of stocks.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,502
In the US,
best example of that is the S&P500.

7
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:26,410
The S&P 500 represents the 500

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,420
largest companies that
are traded on exchanges, and

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,800
that index changes each day according
to the prices of all of its components.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,930
There's similar indexes in
the United Kingdom, Japan,

11
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:46,470
any country or large market has
indexes that represent this.

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:52,090
Now, these indexes are composed of many,
many individual stocks, and

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,440
the market portfolio is a combination
of those stocks in a certain weighting.

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,380
Most of the important indexes
are what we call Cap Weighted.

15
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,700
And what that means is the individual
weight of each stock in the portfolio

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,450
is set according to that
stock's market cap.

17
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,078
So, market cap, if you recall,
stands for Market Capitalization, and

18
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:20,790
it's simply the number of shares
available for the stock times its price.

19
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,830
So to calculate the weight for
any particular stock, you take its

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,770
market cap and divide it by the sum
of the market caps of all the stocks.

21
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,620
Now, if you think back to my example
of the CEO living on an island

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,610
building his product, and there
being many islands and an ocean and

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,010
when market forces rise of fall
that affect all of the islands,

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:52,010
you can think of these large indexes
essentially as being an ocean.

25
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:58,520
Now within each of these oceans if you
like, there are a number of sectors.

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,360
For instance, in the US we typically

27
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,270
break the market into ten different
sectors, I list four of them here.

28
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,650
Energy, technology,
manufacturing, finance and so on.

29
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,760
And these are essentially the islands.

30
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,110
So, if some malaise occurs to,
say, energy stocks,

31
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,570
you can think of that as something
bad happening to the energy island.

32
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,940
These things might be
Saudi Arabia is pumping more oil,

33
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,830
so the cost of oil is going to go down.

34
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,770
That usually would have
a negative impact on energy, so

35
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,500
the energy island would
be negatively impacted.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,600
Same thing with these other sectors.

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,398
The main point here being that positive
and negative news can affect each of

38
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:51,670
these sectors individually without
necessarily affecting the others.

39
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,890
So it's not unusual to break up these
large markets into individual sectors.

40
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,460
Now just recapping before we depart,
when we talk about the market

41
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,370
portfolio in this class, we are almost
always talking about the S&P 500.

42
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,380
And that market portfolio
consists of 500 stocks,

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,950
the largest stocks in the U.S.

44
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,140
that are traded publicly,
with a weighting set like this.

45
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,340
One thing to keep in mind Is some stocks
have surprisingly large weightings.

46
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,992
For instance, Apple and
Exxon each are about 5% of the S&P 500.

47
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:36,090
So those two stocks have a strong
effect on what happens to this index.

48
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,130
There are smaller stocks
that comprise say only

49
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,080
a tenth of a percent of
the overall effect on this market.
