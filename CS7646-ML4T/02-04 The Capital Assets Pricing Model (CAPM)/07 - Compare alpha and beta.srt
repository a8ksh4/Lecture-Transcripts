1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,060
Consider these two scatter plots.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,890
This one is for
stock XYZ versus S and P 500.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,530
This one is for
stock ABC versus S and P 500.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,439
And each one of these dots
represents the return for S and

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,950
P 500 versus ABC or XYZ for
that particular day.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,300
Okay.
So look at these two plots and tell me,

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,880
which one has higher alpha and
which one has higher beta?
