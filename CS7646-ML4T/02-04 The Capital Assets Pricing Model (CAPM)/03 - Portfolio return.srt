00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,360
Okay, let's suppose you've got
two stocks in your portfolio.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,015
Stock A and Stock B and

3
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:11,820
75% of your portfolio is in Stock A and
-25% is in Stock B.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,680
In other words, you've taken
a short position in Stock B.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,578
Now let's suppose on a particular
day Stock A goes up 1%,

6
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:26,490
and stock B goes down 2%.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,100
What's the return on your
portfolio if this occurs
