00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,580
So remember from our equation
on the previous page

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,920
that the return on
the portfolio is the sum of

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,680
each return times the respective
weight added together.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,857
So the weight for
Stock A is .75 times 1% and

5
00:00:16,857 --> 00:00:21,522
the weight for Stock B is negative 25%.

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,210
The return was negative 2% for
that stock also.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,010
So because we shorted B and

8
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,250
it went down, we got a positive
component there, or .5.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,574
And our long on A adds up to .75 so

10
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:38,882
our total is 1.25.
