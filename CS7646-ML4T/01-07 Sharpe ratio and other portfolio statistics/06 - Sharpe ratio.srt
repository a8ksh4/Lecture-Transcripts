00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,720
Sharpe ratio is a metric that
adjusts return for risk.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,190
And it enables us in a quantitative way

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,810
to asses each of these
example compared portfolios.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,820
So Sharpe ratio will show us for
instance, that in this case ABC is

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,760
better because It has about the same
volatility as XYZ, but higher return.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,870
If it were to assess these two, even
though they both have the same return,

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,820
it'll say XYZ is better
because it's got lower risk.

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,360
And finally, in this case where these
two are very close and it's hard for

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,040
us as humans to determine which
one is better, Sharpe ratio here

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,770
will give us a number that will
help us determine between the two.

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,750
So with regard to the numbers that
Sharpe ratio ends up providing us,

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,870
all else being equal, lower risk is
better, higher return is better.

13
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:01,340
Sharpe ratio also considers something
called the risk free rate of return.

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,930
That's the interest rate you would get
on your money if you put it in a risk

15
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,780
free asset like a bank account or
a short term treasury.

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,740
The reason that it includes this number,
is we always need to consider,

17
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,350
gee, maybe this asset we've got

18
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,670
isn't performing as well as the return I
would get it I just put it in the bank.

19
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,670
Now, lately, as of mid-2015,

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,170
the risk free rate of
return is about zero.

21
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:38,900
In other words, if you were to put
your money in the bank or to buy

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,180
very short term treasury bonds, that's
the interest rate they would pay you.

23
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,590
And this is why lately folks have put so
much money into the stock market,

24
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,980
because you can't make money putting
your money in the bank these days.

25
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,960
The Sharpe ratio is named for
William Sharpe.

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,120
And he developed something called
the Sharpe ratio that accounts for

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,440
all of these.

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,940
Now think about what the form of
that equation would look like.
