1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,589
Here's the equation for

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,480
computing the Sharpe ratio as
proposed by William Sharpe himself.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,760
It's the expected value of the return
on a portfolio, minus the risk free

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,560
rate of return, divided by the standard
deviation of that same difference.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,920
This is the ex ante formulation,
meaning, because we're using expected,

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,570
it's a forward looking measure of
what the Sharpe ratio should be.

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,460
Now to calculate this in reality,
we need to look back at those values.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,979
So, for instance, the expected
value of this difference is just

9
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:43,770
simply the mean of what that
difference was over time.

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,540
So to calculate this in Python
using historical data, we just take

11
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,380
the mean of daily returns minus the
daily risk-free rate, and divide that

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,660
by the standard deviation of the daily
returns minus the daily risk-free rate.

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,920
Now you may be wondering,
what is this risk free rate?

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,379
Where can we get it?

15
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,820
Traditionally there are a few
numbers that people use for this.

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,950
One is LIBOR or
the London Interbank Offer Rate.

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,010
Another is the interest rate
on the 3-month Treasury bill.

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,930
And finally, a value that
people have been using a lot

19
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,965
over the last [LAUGH] few years is 0.

20
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:26,720
0 is a good approximation
to the risk free rate.

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,341
Now I've been presenting this as if
this risk free rate changes each day.

22
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:35,840
And indeed, LIBOR changes each day and

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,600
3-month T-bill changes
a little bit each day.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,530
But there's a shortcut people use a lot

25
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,348
that simplifies this
equation significantly.

26
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:49,700
And this shortcut makes sense
because usually the risk free rate

27
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,300
is not given on a daily basis for, for

28
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,140
instance, putting your money in a bank
account or a certificate of deposit.

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,380
Usually that's a percentage on
an annual basis or a six month basis.

30
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,800
So you can convert that

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,550
annual amount into a daily
amount using this simple trick.

32
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,349
Let's suppose our risk free
rate is 10% per year or 0.1.

33
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:18,870
That means if we start at the beginning
of the year with a value of 1.0,

34
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,840
at the end of the year we have 1.1,
so we add 1 here.

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,510
So this is the total value of our
asset at the end of the year.

36
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,840
Now, what is the interest rate per
day that would enable us to get to

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,910
this value?

38
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,620
It's a number that if we multiple
it by itself each day for

39
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,790
each day in the trading year, or
252 times, would arrive at this number.

40
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,880
So here's how we do it.

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,220
We take the 252nd root of that sum,

42
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,840
believe it or not, that's pretty
easy to do in Python actually,

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,670
and subtract 1, and
that is our daily risk free rate.

44
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,155
We are, in most cases in this class,
just going to approximate the daily

45
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:06,280
risk free rate with 0, because that's
what it's been for such a long time.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,080
Of course, it may be changing in the
future, so keep this shortcut in mind.

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,090
Now, suppose we want to use this value,
which is fine.

48
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,590
We would plug that in here,
and also plug it in here.

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,940
So observe that if we
plug a constant in here,

50
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,590
in this standard deviation calculation,
we can just remove it.

51
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,050
Because a set of values
minus a constant,

52
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,670
when you calculate the standard
deviation, is just as if this were 0.

53
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,740
Summing it all up, this is
the equation we typically use for

54
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,640
calculating Sharpe ratio
using daily returns.

55
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,960
We drop the daily risk free rate

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,410
from the standard deviation because
we treat that as a constant.

57
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,685
If our daily risk free rate is greater
than 0, then you need to plug it

58
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:58,250
in here, but we can usually
use a constant there as well.
