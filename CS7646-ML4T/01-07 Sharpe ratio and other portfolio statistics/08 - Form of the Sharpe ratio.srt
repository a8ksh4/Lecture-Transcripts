1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,000
This is the best answer, here's why.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,090
First of all, observe that
we're dividing by volatility

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,320
here on the bottom.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,240
So as things become more volatile,
the ratio goes down.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,000
We've got return on
portfolio here on the top.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,820
So as return goes up,
the metric goes up.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,150
And finally,
we subtract the risk free return here.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:26,470
So as risk free return increases,
the value of our metric decreases.

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,940
Meaning, essentially we need to have
a higher return on our portfolio.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,660
Than the risk free metric in order
to have a positive number here.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,620
This is indeed the form
of the sharp ratio.

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,665
There are a few more details.

13
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:46,090
But this is essentially the ratio
devised by William Sharpe
