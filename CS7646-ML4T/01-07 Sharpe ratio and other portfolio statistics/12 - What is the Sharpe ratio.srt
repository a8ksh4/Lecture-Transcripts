1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,917
The correct answer is 12.7.

2
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:06,004
That's a really,
eye-watering Sharpe ratio.

3
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,668
Anyway, these numbers are just
made up for example, so

4
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:11,403
it's not surprising we might
get an absurd number here.

5
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:14,138
But, here's how we calculate that.

6
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:17,603
Remember our Sharpe ratio
is the square root of 252

7
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:21,922
because that's how frequently
we are sampling the data, daily.

8
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:25,590
252 days in a year, square root of 252.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,526
A lot of people probably saw
this 60 days of data and

10
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:33,020
thought that it should
be square root of 60.

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,402
It's not correct.

12
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,610
It's the frequency that you're sampling.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:43,070
Anyways, getting back to it, it's square
root of 252 times the mean of portfolio

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,820
return minus risk free return divided by
standard deviation of our daily return.

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:58,380
So that becomes square root of 252 times
10 bips minus 2 bips divided by 10 bips.

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,908
This just becomes 0.8, and
multiply it all out, and you get 12.7.
