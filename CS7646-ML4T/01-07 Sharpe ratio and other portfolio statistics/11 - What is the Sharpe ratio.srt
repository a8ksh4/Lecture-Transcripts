1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,380
Assume we've been trading a strategy for
60 days now, and

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,800
on average, our strategy returns
one-tenth of a percent per day.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,480
Another word for
this is 10 basis points.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,680
One basis point is
one-hundredth of a percent.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,430
So ten bps or
basis points is one-tenth of a percent.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,750
Our daily return is,
on average, 10 basis points.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,380
Our risk free rate,

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,400
which we'll assume is just a fixed
number, is 2 basis points per day.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:38,550
And the standard deviation of our daily
return is 10 bips, or 10 basis points.

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,000
What is the Sharpe
ratio of this strategy?
