1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,210
Of course, a natural question is, well,
how accurate are these forecasts?

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,810
Can you act on them?

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,970
Do they really predict the future?

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,990
Well at least a first step towards
answering that question can be found

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,500
by back testing.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,450
So that means you roll back time,
and you test your system.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,690
So here's our historical data as usual
it's organized with time coming down.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,710
Now in order to test
the capability of our approach,

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,350
we have to limit the data it sees
to a certain amount of time and

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,810
then make predictions into
the simulated future.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,290
So we allow our system to only look
at data up to a certain point.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,470
It can use data before
that all it likes.

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,530
It builds a model, and
then makes a forecast.

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,730
On the basis of that forecast,
we can then now place orders,

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,130
anticipating that that
forecast will be achieved.

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,870
So we might long some stocks or
short them as appropriate.

17
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,410
We can take those orders now,
put them into our trading simulator and

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,373
see how the portfolio works.

19
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:07,097
So this time right here is
the same as this time here, so

20
00:01:07,097 --> 00:01:12,952
we enter our positions on that date
which was the same as that date and

21
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:18,514
then we roll it forward and
see what happens with the portfolio.

22
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:22,553
Using software that we've built in this
class, you can measure things like

23
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:25,470
Sharpe ratio, return, and
so on for that portfolio.

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,703
Now we're training over new data,
make a new forecast and

25
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:32,920
then make a new set of orders.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,200
We enter these orders in our trading
simulator and then go forward and

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
see what happens.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,970
I'm optimistic and it's always
going to go up and to the right.

29
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,730
Anyways, this process
can be repeated over and

30
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,860
over again using historical data and

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,210
we can simulate our learning algorithm
and how it would trade in this way.

32
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,480
And that's called backtesting.
