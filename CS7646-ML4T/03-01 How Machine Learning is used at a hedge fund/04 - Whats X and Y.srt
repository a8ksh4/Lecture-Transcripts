1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,880
So the two things that make sense
here as ys are future price,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,710
because we're trying to predict it, or
future return, which is very similar.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,340
All these others are factors that
we might use to predict these two.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,169
So price momentum is a predictive
factor, Bollinger band

5
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:25,700
value's a predictive factor, and
current price might be as well.
