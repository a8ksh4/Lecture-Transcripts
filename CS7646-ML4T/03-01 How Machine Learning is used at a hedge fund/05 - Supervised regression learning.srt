00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,490
The particular flavor of machine
learning that we're going to focus on in

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,670
the first part of this course is
called supervised regression learning.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,410
Those are a few big words.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,497
Let's break it down word by word.

5
00:00:11,497 --> 00:00:14,580
We'll start in the middle
here with regression.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,570
Regression is a weird word.

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,840
I don't think whoever chose it to
represent what it means did a good job,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,420
but we're stuck with it.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,910
All that regression means is we're

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,180
trying to make a numerical approximation
or a numerical prediction.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,160
That's as opposed to
classification learning

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,200
where we might be trying
to classify an object

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,030
into one of several types as opposed
to making a numerical prediction.

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,080
Supervised means that we
show the machine the x and

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,590
also, if you will, the correct answer y.

16
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,190
In fact, we show the machine many,
many examples of x and y, and that's how

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,530
it learns, okay, when I see this x,
this is the y that's associated with it.

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,750
That's the supervised component.

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,570
Finally, when we say learning, what
we mean is we are training with data.

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,030
In this class we're taking
historical stock data and

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,670
training the system to make a prediction
about the future, usually about price.

22
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,350
There are a lot of algorithms
that solve this problem and

23
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,500
are supervised regression
learning techniques.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,080
You've probably heard of
linear regression and used it.

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,070
Linear regression is a method that
finds parameters for a model.

26
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,210
So we call it parametric learning.

27
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,980
K nearest neighbor, or KNN,
is an extremely popular approach.

28
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,860
And in fact, you're going to build
a KNN learner as part of this class.

29
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,760
What's different between parametric
learning and instance based, which KNN

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,150
is an example of, is that in parametric
learning we take the data, munge it

31
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,080
around to come up with a few parameters,
and then throw the data away.

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,310
In k nearest neighbor we keep all
of this historic data, the x and

33
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,440
y pairs, and when it's time to make
a prediction we consult that data.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,210
That's what makes it instance based.

35
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,420
Anyways, we'll spend a lot of time
talking about k nearest neighbor.

36
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,440
Two other techniques that are really
popular are decision trees and

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,110
decision forests.

38
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,920
As you might guess, the way decision
trees work is they store a tree

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,280
structure and when a query comes in,

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,610
it essentially bounces down that tree
according to factors of the data.

41
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,250
Each node in the tree represents
essentially a question,

42
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,170
is this x value greater than or
less than this other value?

43
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,830
And eventually we reach a leaf and that
is the regression value that's returned.

44
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:53,200
Decision forests are simply lots and
lots of decision trees

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,566
taken together, and you query each
one to get an overall result.

46
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:02,030
So this is the definition of
supervised regression learning,

47
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,240
which we're going to use a lot, and

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,010
these are various algorithms
that solve that problem.
