00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,760
Here's a quiz to get you
thinking about that.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,140
So again, e is the error at each point.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,480
In other words,
this is our original data point.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,640
This is the line that we're
hypothesizing might be a good solution.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,830
And we can test how far off our model or

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,630
our line is at each one of these
points and measure that as e.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:31,100
So which of these formulae might
be a good overall error measure?

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,250
There could be more than one.
