1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,110
Most of these are hard.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:02,910
This one's hard.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,120
This one's hard, and this one,
and let me explain why.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,900
This one is hard because of
this flat area here and here.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,965
Suppose the minimizer tested this point
here and then tried on either side.

6
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:20,500
It wouldn't be able to find
any gradient to follow, so,

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,870
it wouldn't know which direction to go.

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,700
This one is difficult for
at least two reasons.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:35,350
One is it has several local minima that
aren't necessarily the global minima.

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,250
So, it might iterate and
find, say, this as a minima.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,755
But notice that actually there's this
other two that are actually smaller.

12
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:50,102
And then if these two have
exactly the same value,

13
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:53,680
turns out we have two global minima.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,290
So, those sorts of conditions are tough
for these minimizers to solve.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,500
This one is challenging A,

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,680
because of this flat area, but
also because of this discontinuity.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,730
So, four examples, three of them would
be hard for our minimizer to solve.

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,700
Now, I'm not saying that these
are not solvable by optimizers.

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,330
In fact, there are optimizers that

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,860
can solve these problems with
varying degrees of success.

21
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,780
And they're likely to find a minima,
just not guaranteed to find the minima.
