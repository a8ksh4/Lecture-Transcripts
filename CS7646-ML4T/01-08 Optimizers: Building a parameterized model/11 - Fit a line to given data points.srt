1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,360
Now we'll look at some example code that
can fit a line to data that's given.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,190
Remember, we're using
a optimizer to do this.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,940
And first thing we have
to do is describe for

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,410
the optimizer what is the function
it's trying to minimize.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:26,490
So we'll call this function error, and
it takes two parameters, line and data.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,220
Line is just two coefficients,
C0 and C1.

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,709
And data is just a list of data,
of course.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,600
Well, we've got some nice comments
here that explain it, but

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,260
really, our error is expressed
simply in this single equation.

10
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,830
We have the value of the actual
data at each point here,

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,880
minus the estimate that the line
we're currently looking at

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,020
would give at that same point.

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,360
So we use the 0 coefficient, and

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,960
the 1 coefficient, times the x
value of the data at that point.

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,580
So we take those differences and square
it, and that's our error function.

16
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,750
And that's what we're
trying to minimize.

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,490
We've added some code to illustrate

18
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,330
how to use the minimizer to
find the equation of a line.

19
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:28,840
We start with our original line
that the minimizer doesn't know.

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,910
So, it's our secret, [LAUGH] but

21
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:36,400
we're testing it to see if the minimizer
can discover the equation of this line.

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,860
Here's the equation for our line.

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,410
It's just a two element array.

24
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,620
It'll have a slope of four so
coefficient zero is four.

25
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,470
And Y intercept of two.

26
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,880
So coefficient one of two.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,160
Here we generate X and Y values.

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,300
Again keep in mind our minimizer doesn't
know these but we are just generating

29
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,430
them so we can look at them and we are
plotting them for looking at it later.

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,180
We take that original line and

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,330
we use from numpie the random
function to add some noise to it.

32
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:20,220
So at each point along the X-axis,
where we have data, we add some noise.

33
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,240
So, now we've got our original line,
plus some noise, and

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,030
we're going to challenge our
minimizer to find the equation for

35
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,510
that original line,
even though there's noise.

36
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,920
We wrote a separate function
fit_line that takes the data and

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,000
the error function we defined and
finds the equation for that line.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,490
Here's fit_line it does that for us.

39
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,690
Two parameters the data, remember this
is noisy data that is approximately

40
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,310
a line and in other words we took our
original line and added noise to it.

41
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,300
And the error function, or
the function we're trying to minimize.

42
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,860
We have some nice comments here
that tell us what those are, but

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,820
now we just follow the steps
like we've talked about before.

44
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,910
We start with an initial guess.

45
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,760
Here our initial guess
is a slope of zero, and

46
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,330
a mean of the rest of
the data as our y intercept.

47
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,960
It could be anything really,
but that is a reasonable guess.

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,380
We plot the initial guess so
we have something to look at, and

49
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,950
I'll show you that later.

50
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,320
But here really is
the meat of the function.

51
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,890
You've seen it before.

52
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,360
So we call our minimize
function with the error_func.

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,380
In other words, this is the function
we're trying to minimize.

54
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,670
Our initial guess, and this is
a parameter you haven't seen before,

55
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:50,420
but this is a way by which we can
pass the data to our error function.

56
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,050
This is the method that
we're going to use.

57
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,819
And finally although it
goes off the end here.

58
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,900
We'll set display to true,

59
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,390
which will mean we'll get to see
any information as it goes along.

60
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,700
So that's it.

61
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,210
I mean really the key here for this is,

62
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,740
this minimize call right here and
then it returns the result.

63
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,880
So let's run it and see what we get.

64
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,700
There was some additional code that I
skipped over that generated this plot.

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,500
You can look at that on your own,
of course.

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,450
Okay, let's take a look.

67
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,990
Our original line is this blue line.

68
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,950
Of course the minimizer doesn't
know anything about that.

69
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,900
These green dots are our noisy data

70
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,900
where we just added noise
values to the blue line.

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,720
Now we're asking our optimizer,

72
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,290
okay find the equation of a line
that best fits this data.

73
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,680
The metric you're trying
to minimize is error.

74
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,350
So we passed it in an initial guess
here of this purple line and this data.

75
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,260
So that's all it knows right now
is this initial guess of a purple

76
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,990
line and this data.

77
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,400
And then it iterates and tries different
slopes and different y intercepts.

78
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,340
Until finally, it converges to this
red line and that's the solution.

79
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,150
And I think it looks pretty decent.

80
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:27,100
We can check it here, so
if you look in the code, you'll see that

81
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:33,250
our real line had a slope of four and
a y intercept of 0.5.

82
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:40,130
So we've got 4.17 and 0.64, not exactly.

83
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,670
But if you look at
the data you can see that

84
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,790
it's pretty hard to know exactly what
the underlying line would look like.

85
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,560
So, I think our equation
solver did a pretty good job.
