1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,230
So to illustrate
the importance of covariance,

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,610
we're going to take a look at
a couple different stocks here.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,530
These are pretend, of course.

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,050
So here's one, ABC, it's gone up 10%.

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:17,040
Here's another stock, GHI,
it's also gone up 10%.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,770
But notice it tends
to zig when ABC zags,

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,170
so it's not going in lockstep with ABC.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,320
Finally, here's our last stock
that we'll take a look at, DEF.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,050
Note how it goes almost
in lockstep with ABC.

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,900
So, three stocks, two that move together
very similarly, and one that moves

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:46,005
opposite them sometimes, yet
they've all provided about 10% return.

12
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,920
What is the best portfolio

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,590
we can build by combining
these three different stocks?

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,230
So, let's consider their covariance, or
how they move together, for a moment.

15
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,990
So ABC and DEF move very similarly.

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,000
And if we were to measure their
covariance, and this is the covariance

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,380
of daily returns, which if you're just
looking at one stock versus another,

18
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,440
that's the same as the correlation
coefficient of their daily returns.

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,050
So 0.9 means that they move
very closely to one another.

20
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:26,220
Now, if we were to look at the
co-variance of daily returns of ABC and

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,400
GHI, we would find that they actually
have a negative correlation.

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,610
In other words, when ABC goes up,
GHI tends to go down.

23
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:42,747
So they actually have a negative
correlation, or a negative covariance,

24
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:47,870
whereas ABC and
DEF have a positive covariance.

25
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,070
Again now, what's the best
way to blend these together?

26
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,060
So lets consider a couple
different portfolios,

27
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,630
which are just weightings
on these different assets.

28
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:02,440
Let's look first at one that
is 50% ABC and 50% DEF.

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,050
So what's that one going to look like?

30
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,870
Well, they both move very similarly, so

31
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,340
this portfolio is going to
track the two of them together.

32
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,930
So the performance of this portfolio
is going to look something like this.

33
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,490
So that's fine, it ends up returning
10%, just like the two major assets that

34
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,530
it holds, but there's no real advantage
in blending these two assets because

35
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,890
it just has the same volatility as
each one of them by themselves.

36
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,200
So what if we try something
a little bit different?

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,690
What if we take 25% of ABC, 25% of DEF,
so that's going to give us this same

38
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,100
motion that we saw here when
we combined those two, but,

39
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,910
we put the rest of it in GHI?

40
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,980
So now we're combining an anticorrelated
asset with these other two.

41
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,530
So what's this portfolio
going to look like?

42
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,110
Well, it's going to be a nice
blend of them, with very

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,750
low volatility, because when one zigs,
the other zags.

44
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,470
So this portfolio will also have a 10%
return, but look how smooth it is.

45
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,450
And that's because we're blending
anticorrelated assets together.

46
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:17,780
So we get the same return but lower
volatility than any asset by itself.

47
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,400
So all these assets by themselves
had significant volatility, but

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,630
when we put them together,
we reduced volatility significantly.

49
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,210
That's the magic of what
Markowitz provided, and

50
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,030
we'll look a little bit more
at that in just a moment.
