1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:05,560
If we're going to find a portfolio or an
allocation of assets to different stocks

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,830
that minimizes risk, we have to pause
for a moment and consider what is risk.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:17,111
Let's consider two stocks, XYZ,
here that's gone up about ten percent,

4
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:19,570
but as you can see,
it's been very volatile.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,190
Here's the historical price
of another stock, ABC.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,860
It also went up ten percent over this
same time period, but as you can see,

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,340
it was less volatile.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,230
So it's this volatility that we
use as a measure of risk and

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,030
that is simply the standard deviation
of historical daily returns.

10
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,360
Again, in this case,
risk is measured as volatility or

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,530
standard deviation of
historical daily returns.

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,830
That's the standard view of
risk in most finance texts.

13
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,540
There are other ways to view
risk that we touch upon here and

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:59,140
there through this course but the key
is standard deviation of daily returns.
