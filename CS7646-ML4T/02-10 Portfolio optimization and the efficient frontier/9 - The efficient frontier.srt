00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,330
There's one last topic I wanted to
talk about with regard to portfolio

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,600
optimizers and modern portfolio theory.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,040
Consider these assets, and
also recognize that for

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,920
any particular return level,
there is an optimal portfolio.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,960
So let's suppose we picked
this return level, and

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,970
that this is the optimal portfolio.

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,750
In other words, this portfolio reflects
weightings of all these assets

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,100
that provides the lowest risk for
this particular return.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,420
Now, we can compute this for
all the potential returns

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,840
from the minimum return stock
here up to the maximum.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,580
And if we did that for all of them, in
fact there's an infinite number of them,

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,520
so we couldn't really do it for
all of them.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,040
You get a line.

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,190
So our maximum return
portfolio is up here and

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,390
it would consist entirely
of that one asset.

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,060
But as we bring the return down we
find a number of other portfolios

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,060
all the way down to here.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,970
A couple of different things to
observe that are interesting.

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,830
One is as you reduce the return
sometimes this curve comes back

20
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,020
in this direction,

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,590
indicating that actually the risk is
increasing as we reduce the return.

22
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,440
So for the most part, people don't
want those sorts of portfolios.

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,800
In other words, who wants a lower
returning portfolio with more risk.

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,100
So we typically look only at
portfolios above this line.

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,390
As you might have guessed, the name of
this line is the efficient frontier.

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,730
So what does that mean,
the efficient frontier?

27
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,400
It means that there are essentially
no portfolios out here.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,540
And that any portfolio that's
on this side of the frontier,

29
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,610
it's suboptimal in some way.

30
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,850
So for instance,
if you had a portfolio here,

31
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,810
you are assuming this much risk, for

32
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,340
a lower return than you could have, than
if you were up here on the frontier.

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,380
Or if you were targeting
this much return,

34
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,920
you could be over here
with regard to risk.

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,840
So any portfolio inside here is not
efficient because it's either higher

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,630
risk or lower return than it could be
if we were on the efficient frontier.

37
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,210
One last thing to mention about
the efficient frontier is if you draw

38
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,000
a tangent line from the origin
to the frontier where it

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,010
hits is the max sharp ratio
portfolio for all of these assets.

40
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,460
In practice the efficient
frontier isn't used for

41
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,930
that much other than as a theoretical
device, but people do often like to plot

42
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,700
the efficient frontier so they can see
where there portfolio is In relation to

43
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:49,330
the assets that they're using and where
they could be in terms of efficiency.

44
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,570
Okay, that is all.

45
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,720
I will see you online soon.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,560
Thank you very much.
