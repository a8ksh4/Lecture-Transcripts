1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,605
When Markowitz added to the game was
this consideration of variance and

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,330
co-variance between individual stocks.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,030
And the recognition
that you want to blend

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,480
those together that
have anti-correlation.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,460
So you can have a much lower
risk portfolio if you combine

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,011
assets that are anti-correlated.

7
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:23,670
Or anti-varianced.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,850
[LAUGH] If that is a word.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,390
Because when one moves up,
the other moves down.

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,510
They cancel each other out.

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,870
And you have much less volatility.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,009
Now of course you want, overall,

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,720
all these assets to in
general move up together.

14
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,500
So often what we are looking for is
anti-correlation in the short term and

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,790
positive correlation in a longer term.

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,820
But out of this work grew
a number of algorithms,

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,660
one of the key ones being
mean variance optimization.

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,820
Which is a way of taking a potential
set of assets and figuring out how they

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,050
should be blended together by looking at
their co-variance among other things.

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:09,200
So lets consider this group of assets
here and how we might combine them or

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,640
allocate funds to them to
provide a good portfolio.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,870
One thing I didn't point out
before that I want to mention now.

23
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,810
Is it generally the higher
return stocks or assets,

24
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,228
whatever they might be tend
to also be the highest risk.

25
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:29,200
So as we roll down the risk we
tend to also look at lower return.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,330
Now again, how do we combine
these into a good portfolio?

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,560
Here's what goes in to
a mean variance optimizer.

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,450
These are the factors that it considers.

29
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,640
So for each stock you have to
provide an expected return.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,310
In other words,

31
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,380
what do we think in the future it's
going to provide in terms of return.

32
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,560
You also provide volatility and
covariance.

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,990
Volatility is simply historically
how volatile has each

34
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,050
one of these assets been.

35
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:07,120
Covariance is a matrix which
shows between each asset and

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,950
every other asset, what is
the correlation of daily returns.

37
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,750
So it takes all of these into
account when it is searching for

38
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,040
the right waiting for
each of these stocks in a portfolio.

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,880
So the last and

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,360
perhaps one of the most important
inputs to this is the target return.

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,510
We can target a return anywhere
from the max return asset

42
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,340
to the min return asset.

43
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,710
And then anything else between those, of
course, we can accomplish by blending.

44
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,500
So let's suppose this is
the level of our target return.

45
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,530
So I'll just put a dotted line here so
we can mark that for later.

46
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,030
So the output of an optimizer is
a set of weights, one weight for

47
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,700
each asset,
that provides the target return.

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,240
But minimizes risk, so in the end we're
looking for a portfolio that's out here.

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,250
In other words it's got risk that's even
lower than any of the individual assets.

50
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,480
But it meets the target return.

51
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,560
And this is possible because
we consider covariance.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,960
We're only looking at individual risk

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,510
we wouldn't be able to find the right
blend that would bring us out here.

54
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,440
Now that's it for optimization and
the insights from Markowitz.

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,420
But there's one more thing to look at
with regards to optimizers that I'm

56
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,260
going to show you next.
