1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,170
There are hundreds of technical
indicators out there.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,010
We're going to take a look at
just three because, of course,

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,370
our time is limited but I will point you
to resources online where you can learn

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,260
about other indicators.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,040
Theres three are some of the most common
and most popular that people use.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,770
The three we will look at are momentum,
simple moving average, and

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,560
Bollinger Bands.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,680
Let's take a look first at momentum.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,580
Momentum is really one of
the simplest indicators, and

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,350
it's just over some number of days
how much has the price changed.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,160
So for instance,

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,910
if we look at this point to this point,
we've got positive momentum.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,690
Or if we were to look from here to here,
we've got negative momentum.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,950
The steepness of that line is
the strength of the momentum,

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,750
either positive or negative.

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,710
Now, in terms of using this in a trading
strategy, there are many folks who look

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,240
at the momentum for a stock, the recent
momentum, and if it's positive they buy,

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,650
because they anticipate that
the momentum is going to continue.

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,269
Now, I'm not necessarily
recommending that to you.

20
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,308
I'm just telling you
how some people use it.

21
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:12,150
Now I'm going to show
you in a later slide,

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,210
how we can use momentum as
part of a combined strategy.

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,200
Now, you can see here how we
can look at momentum visually.

24
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,050
But for

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,490
machine learning, which of course we're
going to get to in the next mini course,

26
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,760
we actually need to convert these to
numbers that we can use quantitatively.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,850
And, of course, this course is
about quantitative analysis.

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,760
So there's always, for
technical analysis, a graphical or

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,920
visual presentation, but we need to also
consider the quantitative presentation.

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,020
So, when we talk about momentum, we talk
about how many days of momentum that is.

31
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,430
So, that might be n days,
where we use n right there.

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,050
So, n might be a number like 5 or
10 and so on.

33
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,100
Here's the pseudo code for how we
compute momentum on a particular day.

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,560
So let's suppose this
is day t right here.

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,410
We just take the price
as of that day and

36
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,780
we divide it by the price in
days earlier and subtract 1.

37
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,740
So this will give us a number, say 0.1,

38
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:26,110
if the price has gone up 10% or
-0.1, if it's gone down 10%.

39
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,412
So we usually see numbers in
the range of, say, about -0.5 for

40
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:35,975
a big, significant,
50% drop, to about +0.5.

41
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:37,880
So on any particular day,

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,940
this is how we would calculate the value
of this technical indicator momentum.
