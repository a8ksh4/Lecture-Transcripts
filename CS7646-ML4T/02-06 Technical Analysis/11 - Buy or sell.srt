1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,250
Let's take a look at this first one.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,230
So we went from outside the upper
band and crossed down inside it.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,610
That is a sell signal because we've gone
very far from the moving average, and

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,010
we've validated now that we're moving
back towards the moving average so

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,110
that's a sell.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:27,640
Here, we've gone from inside to outside,
and that is never a signal.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,730
It does indicate, of course,

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,490
a significant excursion from the moving
average, but we're looking for

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,520
the validation that it comes back
inside, so this is not a signal at all.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,920
Here however we've come back
through that bottom band, and

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,330
that is a buy signal.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,220
Finally for this last one, number four,
we've gone outside the lower band and

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,360
we've transitioned up inside it,
that is a buy signal.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,320
So that's Bollinger bands and
how you might use them.
