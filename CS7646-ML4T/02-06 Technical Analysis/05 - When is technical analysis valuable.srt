00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,910
So over the last few years I've been
using technical analysis a lot.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,650
I've also been using
fundamental analysis.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,720
And people often ask me well, you know,
when is one valuable versus the other.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,920
Let's look first at technical
analysis and where it's effective.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,070
Here's some rules of
thumb that I've built for

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,290
myself over the last few years.

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:28,260
First is individual indicators,
by themselves, are weakly predictive.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,720
Now back in the 80's and

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,230
90s when some of these were creative,
I believe they had stronger value.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,750
But since that time, more and more
people have been trading according to

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,030
them, and essentially the more people
who are following a particular approach,

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,380
the less value is realized
by any person by themselves.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,000
So individual indicators are weak.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,850
However, combining multiple
indicators adds value.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,837
I see over and over again that
combinations of three to five different

16
00:00:56,837 --> 00:01:00,890
indicators, in a machine learning
context, provide a much stronger

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,120
predictive system than just
an individual indicator.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,050
Another useful approach is to look for
contrasts.

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,100
In other words, look for one stock that
has a strongly different indicator

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,030
than another stock, or a stock
that is contrasting to the market.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,500
In other words, if all stocks are
behaving in the same way as the market,

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,780
there's no reason to pick any
one stock over another, but

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,630
if you see certain stocks
are behaving differently

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,400
than the market then they
are worth a further look.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,230
Finally, technical analysis generally

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,440
works better over shorter time
periods than longer time periods.
