00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,950
Let's wrap up technical analysis now.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:07,840
So to review, technical indicators
are really heuristics that represent

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,870
someone's interpretation or
hunch of how a statistical approach to

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,730
previous prices and volume might
suggest future price movement.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,620
The particular examples that I've
provided here are my approach.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,340
So if you go look up, for instance,
on John Bollinger's website how to use

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,670
Bollinger Bands, you might discover
his approach is slightly different.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,870
I showed you specifically how I have
found them to be useful in the past.

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,910
Finally, lots of times when people get
exposed to technical analysis they get

10
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,990
really excited and
they want to run off and start trading.

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,475
Well, hold your horses,
there's a lot more to learn.

12
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:48,700
So stick with it, and
we'll see you in the next lesson.
