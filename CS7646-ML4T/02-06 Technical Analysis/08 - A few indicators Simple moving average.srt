1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:02,950
Our next indicator is simple
moving average or SMA.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:09,360
And again, it's indexed by n, which
is how many days are we looking back.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,190
So if we want to calculate the value of
the simple moving average for this day,

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,880
we look back over n days, and
this is called an n-day window.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,190
So the SMA for

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:28,140
today is simply the average of
the values over this look back period.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,100
So it would be a value
about right there.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,980
And if we carry it forward,
it'll look like this.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,270
So, the SMA looks
essentially like a smoothed

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,540
value of the price chart
as it moves around.

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,030
And an important thing to note
is it sort of lags the movement.

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,400
So as we started down here,
it slowly started coming down,

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,230
and when we started up here,
it lagged that movement upwards.

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,190
There are at least two different
ways that technicians use

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,560
simple moving average as
parts of trading strategies.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,920
The first is they look for

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,810
places where the current price crosses
through the simple moving average.

18
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,740
Those tend to be important events,
especially if the average is over many,

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,180
many days.

20
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,620
If you combine that with momentum,
in other words,

21
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,700
the price has strong momentum, and

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,340
it's crossing through that simple
moving average, that can be a signal.

23
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,220
This particular crossing,

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,790
where the price goes through the simple
moving average, doesn't really

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,420
illustrate strong momentum
because it just started going up.

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,770
However, when you do see strong momentum
crossing those lines, then again,

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,190
that can be a trading signal.

28
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:46,140
Another way that technicians use simple
moving average is as a proxy for

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,990
underlying value.

30
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,850
In other words, if you look back
over a certain period of time and

31
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,798
take that average price, that might
represent the true value of the company.

32
00:01:55,798 --> 00:02:00,650
And if we see a large excursion from
that price, we should, for instance,

33
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,790
here and here, we should expect that

34
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,080
the price is eventually going to
come back down to that average.

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,690
And so it's an arbitrage opportunity,

36
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,700
sort of like we saw with
fundamental analysis.

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,070
And again, for example, there's a large
excursion downward here, so this might

38
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,280
represent a buy opportunity, and these
two might represent sell opportunities.

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Because there was a strong
diversion from that moving average.

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,640
Now we talked about earlier how
every technical indicator has

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,490
a visual presentation like
I'm showing you here, but

42
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,800
we also need a way to quantify it,
to turn it into a number.

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,620
The way we do that is to compare
the current price with the current

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,200
simple moving average,
and construct a ratio.

45
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,580
So, in this case, we would look for
a negative value.

46
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,970
And in these cases,
we'd want to see positive values.

47
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,100
So, if we were to calculate, say, the
value of the simple moving average on

48
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,580
this day, we take the price for
that day, and

49
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,270
we compute the mean for
the last n-days, which is here.

50
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,850
And remember, this is over
a look back window of n-days.

51
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,485
Divide that into the price and
subtract one.

52
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:21,312
So, if, for instance, the price is
10% above the simple moving average,

53
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:24,332
we'd end up getting a positive 0.1.

54
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:28,120
If it were 10% below,
we'd get a negative 0.1.

55
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:35,410
So similar to the momentum, we
typically see values here ranging from,

56
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,364
at most, minus 50% to plus 50%.
