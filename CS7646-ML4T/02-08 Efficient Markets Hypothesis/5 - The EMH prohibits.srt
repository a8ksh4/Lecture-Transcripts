1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,746
Consider the three forms of
the deficient markets hypothesis.

2
00:00:04,746 --> 00:00:09,200
Weak, semi-strong, and strong.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,710
Which one of these types of analyses or

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,720
strategies would these corresponding
versions of the EMH would prohibit?

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,790
So for instance if you think that
the weak version of the efficient market

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,210
hypothesis prevents fundamental
analysis from working.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,290
You would check the box there.

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,050
Okay, have at it.
