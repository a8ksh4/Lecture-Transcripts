1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,990
There's a number of places
information can come from.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:09,670
Let's step through a few of these sorted
from most public to least public.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,100
But even this is certainly
not an exhaustive list.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,390
There's many other places
we can get information.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,410
But let's step through them.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,290
Price volume, this is public.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,080
It's rapid, it's quick,
everybody can see it.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,260
This is the basis of technical analysis.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,440
Fundamental data.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,110
This is reported quarterly and
everybody can see it as well.

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,550
It's public, but it points more to the
root of the value of the company than

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,910
just the price volume.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,140
Exogenous data, that's a fancy name for
a simple concept.

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,160
It's just information about
the world that effects the company.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,550
As an example, if we were looking at
an airline stock, an exogenous piece

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,310
of data that would effect the price of
the airline stock is the price of oil.

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,110
If price of oil goes down,
usually the price of the airline stock

18
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,970
goes up because energy is
the number one cost for airlines.

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,640
A very important and

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,980
secretive type of information
relates to company insiders.

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,090
So, let's suppose you're a CEO, and

22
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,880
you know that this drug that you've
invented is about to be improved.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,390
You might go buy shares of your
stock because you think the price of

24
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,710
your stock is going to go up because
that drug is going to be approved.

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,180
Now, depending on the circumstance
it may or may not be legal, but this

26
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,170
reflects information that you have that
people outside the company do not have.

27
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,430
And so this insider information
is probably the least accessible

28
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,200
of all these types, of course, and of
most other types of information as well.

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,090
Now, each of these types of information

30
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,900
has a relationship to
the efficient markets hypothesis.

31
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,050
In particular there's three forms of
the efficient markets hypothesis.

32
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,040
And these types of information
relate to each of these three forms.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,560
We'll get in to that in just a second.
