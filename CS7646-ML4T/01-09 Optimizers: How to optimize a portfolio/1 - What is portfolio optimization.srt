00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,200
Your final project in this mini course
is to create a portfolio optimizer.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,700
That might sound like a tough problem,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,750
but you've already got
the tools to do it.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,990
In this short lesson, we're going to
lay the groundwork to help you know

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,210
what portfolio optimization is and
how to build one.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,700
First, what is portfolio optimization?

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,900
Given a set of assets and a time period,

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,640
find an allocation of funds to
assets that maximizes performance.

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,820
What is performance?

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,170
We could choose from a number of
metrics, including cumulative return,

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:42,740
volatility or risk, and risk adjusted
return, which is Sharpe ratio [LAUGH].

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,760
You can use any criteria you like,
but for this assignment,

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,020
we're going to focus on Sharpe ratio.

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,700
Now, let me show you how to use
a minimizer to optimize a portfolio.
