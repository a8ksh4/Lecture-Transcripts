00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,680
Suppose I were to give you
the following problem.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,300
Take these four stocks and
over a particular time period,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,790
I want you to find the optimal
allocation to those four stocks.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,890
I might ask you to find the optimal
allocation that maximizes

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,020
cumulative return, minimizes volatility,
or maximizes Sharpe ratio.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,110
Which of these optimizers would
be the easiest to write and why?
