1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,298
The answer is, it would be easiest to
write an optimizer that optimizes for

2
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:06,750
cumulative return.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,700
Because all you have to do is find
the single stock that maximized

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,950
return over that time period.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,340
If you're going to optimize for
minimum volatility or Sharpe ratio,

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,880
you actually have to evaluate various
combinations of those stocks.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,260
In this case the allocation would just
be 100% to the highest returning stock.
