1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,100
There's two more things you need
to know about before you start

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,790
optimizing portfolios.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,760
One of them will help your
optimization run faster.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,790
And the other is essential for
you to get the right answer.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,820
We'll start with the faster thing first.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,320
The first thing you can do is
you can tell the optimizer

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,090
that it should only look
at certain ranges for X.

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:28,310
In other words, for this problem,
for each of the various allocations,

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,790
it's only worth looking at
values between 0 and 1.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,820
In other words, the value of
2 would indicate 200% of your

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,050
fund is in a particular asset and
that's not possible.

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,304
It's only feasible to have 0% to 100% or

13
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:48,450
0 to 1 in each of these assets.

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,890
So, you can tell the optimizer
only focus on values between 0 and

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,270
1 for each of the dimensions of X.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,220
And if you do that,
the optimizer can run much more

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,240
quickly because it knows not to look at
other values of X outside those bounds.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,070
It limits the search area significantly.

19
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,747
Another thing you can do with
the optimizers in numbpie are provide

20
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:15,470
constraints.

21
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,400
Constraints are properties of
the values of X that must be true.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,170
As an example we want the sum of
our allocations to add up to one.

23
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,508
So let's say for example we're for
portfolio of four holdings.

24
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:33,758
So we have X0, X1, X2, X3.

25
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:39,026
We want the sum of the absolute
values of those to be equal to 1.0.

26
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:43,370
In other words, our total
allocation should add up to 100%.

27
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:49,050
The optimizers we use in this class have
the ability for you to express that and

28
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,730
that guarantees that at the end
when it finds out the values for X,

29
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,340
you end up with a total of 100%
allocated to the various assets.

30
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,310
Now we're going to show you how to do
these two things in the assignment text

31
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,140
itself, because the syntax
is a little bit tricky and

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,310
we want to convey to you
exactly how to do that.

33
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,430
So we look forward to seeing
you solve this problem and

34
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,890
good luck on your final project.
