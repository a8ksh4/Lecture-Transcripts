1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,750
I'm Tucker Balch, we're here with
Tammer Kamel, founder of Quandl.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,970
We're going to dive now into details
about how the Quandl platform works.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,520
So let's start with
sort of a big picture,

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,880
imagine I'm a hedge fund and
I'm interested in working with Quandl.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,090
How does Quandl fit in to my work flow?

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,190
>> Right.
So in any hedge fund where quantitative

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,510
thinking is some or
part of the investment strategy,

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,860
then at the very start of that process,
is good, high-quality data.

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,840
And that's where Quandl starts and
finishes, in a sense.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,050
We view it as our mission to get the
data that professional investors need

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,190
into their hands and
into the format that they need it in.

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,980
>> So Quandl offers a hedge
fund literally dozens of

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,470
mechanisms to pull that data.

14
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,900
Whether it's a low level API and they
can pull the data right into a database

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,360
that they're maintaining themselves,
or into Python or R,

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,740
or MatLab or Stata or
any analysis tool they might be using.

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,988
But we consider our job,
mission accomplished for

18
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:08,530
Quandl, if we quickly and

19
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,020
painlessly get the hedge fund the data
they need into the system they want.

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,954
>> Now presumably, this includes
a combination of historical data and

21
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,420
live data.

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,490
Are all of your feeds
historical as well as live?

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,030
Or are there some that
are special in some way?

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:35,570
>> Right, so all of our data is
historical for sure, and updated daily.

25
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,140
Live data is a little bit
in the future for us,

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,600
it's not available on
the platform as of this moment.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,320
>> So I could imagine
a flow something like this.

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,910
Lots of people are on a daily cycle.

29
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,200
I think that's a majority
of what people do.

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,990
You might read historical data to inform
your model or build some sort of model.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:01,430
But after market close, you wait
some period until the market data

32
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,730
is available and then whatever data one
might pull from Quandl, do some number

33
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,350
crunching overnight and put in orders
for what you might do in the next day.

34
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,300
Now what time does
your data available and

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,700
what mechanisms do
people use to pull it?

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,338
>> So what you described is really
a canonical use case for Quandl, right.

37
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:26,820
A fund or an analyst will take
the historical data, build and

38
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,660
calibrate a model, and when they're
comfortable that it's ready for

39
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,670
action, then they're going to
start executing on it.

40
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,150
So Quandl market data is updated
pretty quickly after the close,

41
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,630
within minutes or depending on the exact
database, we're talking about ours so.

42
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,780
But definitely in time to run today's
numbers through your model to get

43
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,798
the output and know what actions need
to be taken on the next trading day.

44
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:57,610
>> So I love to learn details about how
people build complex financial systems.

45
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,073
So where do your machines live?

46
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:04,070
>> So
Quandl is quite modern in that respect.

47
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,680
Everything lives in the Cloud.

48
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,430
We're customers of Amazon,
like so many others are.

49
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,500
At the heart of Quandl is a modern,
no SQL database.

50
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,440
And that's where the 15,

51
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,210
16 million times series,
few billion data points live there.

52
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,110
On top of that, we've built an API.

53
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,210
And then the Quandl website itself,

54
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,430
interestingly, is itself just
another client of the Quandl API.

55
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,430
If you look at our website, you will
discover it's perfectly orthodox.

56
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,400
It's a standard Ruby on Rails website,

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,280
built very conventionally, it's just
another client of the Quandl API.

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,630
>> Why the choice of no SQL?

59
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,470
>> So because of scalability, right?

60
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:57,280
We really need to be able to deliver
lots of numerical data to lots of people

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,800
very, very quickly.

62
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,780
The number of data points in
the Quandl database is in the order of

63
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,211
a few billion now, but
we expect that to be 10 or 20 or

64
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,520
50 billion within a year or
two, and at that point,

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,279
conventional relational databases
get kind of difficult to work with.

66
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,576
>> So the glue between the various
components is Ruby on Rails?

67
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:21,399
>> It is, indeed, yeah.

68
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,610
>> So it's no SQL and
Ruby on Rails, and that's it?

69
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,400
>> That is it.

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,550
Quandl is,
by software engineering standards,

71
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,922
pretty plain, vanilla,
simple implementation.

72
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:38,470
Where Quandl, where we sweat day-to-day

73
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,860
is usually in maintaining
the accuracy of 12 million data sets.

74
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,100
The technical infrastructure is,
not to say it's trivial, but

75
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,840
it's conventional best
practices software engineering.

76
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,530
>> Getting back to the data,
tell me a little bit about timestamping.

77
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,390
Let me tell you what I'm getting at.

78
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,970
So let's just consider
market close data.

79
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,670
So the price for a particular stock
essentially is stamped at 4 o'clock,

80
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,885
so one potential timestamp for
that data is New York time,

81
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:13,770
[LAUGH] one potential timestamp for
that data is 4PM,

82
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,740
but maybe I can't observe it until 4:05.

83
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,100
That's just one example.

84
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,185
But I'm curious, does that sort of time
stamping feed into what you all do?

85
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:26,650
>> Yeah,
that's actually a really good point.

86
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,840
I suppose what you're getting at is the
risk of creating a look-ahead bias in

87
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,890
your analysis, right?

88
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,550
>> Yeah.
You know what,

89
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,020
I can't claim that Quandl has any sort
of panaceas for that sort of thing.

90
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,940
We time stamped the data, of course.

91
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:47,040
And the meticulous, diligent analyst
should be aware of this kind of thing.

92
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,630
And they'll see that this database is

93
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,140
the 4PM closing prices, but-
>> This more likely did occur with

94
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,890
things like earnings reports.

95
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,450
>> Yeah.

96
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,250
With those sort of things,
we reach to the vendors and

97
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,647
the publishers for this, but they are
acutely aware of that, so you'll see.

98
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:05,770
Take for example our earnings data.

99
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,020
They're both as reported to the point
and time data and revised data.

100
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,610
So those kind of blatant
risks of the look-ahead bias,

101
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,250
those are well mitigated.

102
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,490
>> When you look at your various
vendors who are providing you data,

103
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,470
what sorts of flaws do
you see in that data and

104
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,720
what sorts of steps to you have
to take to mitigate those flaws?

105
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,320
>> It's interesting,

106
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,340
there's no such thing as a perfect
data set in this world, right, and

107
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,340
we're of course strongly motivated to
get as close to that ideal as possible.

108
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,980
The way we've done it is kind of simple,
but also a little bit original.

109
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,370
And it falls from the mechanism we've
set up, where consumers of data

110
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,260
have a direct relationship with
the publishers of those data.

111
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,800
And indeed, the publisher of the data's
livelihood depends on keeping that

112
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,750
consumer satisfied or happy.

113
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,280
And so unlike sort of many
other data platforms,

114
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,840
where there's a lot of opacity
between the end user and

115
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,430
a lot of layers too, between the end
user and the actual publisher.

116
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,276
In fact, you might in many cases,
not even be able to reach the publisher.

117
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:13,250
Quandl has this direct relation.

118
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,090
So what you find is that if and
when there's errors in the data,

119
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,970
our publishers are very keen
to correct it, and fast.

120
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,110
Because they've got 5 or 10 or

121
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,500
50 customers who know it's them
who are responsible for it, and

122
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,410
they're keen to keep these
people paying for the service.

123
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,870
Right?
So this is an amazing,

124
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,100
this is a reality that
happens in many marketplaces.

125
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,750
When you start removing the distance
between the end consumer and

126
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,250
the actual producer of the product,
you get this quality improvement.

127
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,180
The other thing that, of course,

128
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,090
affects that is good old healthy
competition on a marketplace.

129
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,140
We actually, right now, for some
databases, we have two or more vendors

130
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:02,100
offering competing products and nothing
drives quality control like competition.

131
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,290
>> Okay, great interview.

132
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,080
Thanks very much.

133
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,695
I'm sure the students out there
will find this fascinating.

134
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:11,445
Thanks for your time,
I really appreciate that.

135
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:17,755
That's the end of this discussion with
Tammer Kamel, and we'll see you online.
