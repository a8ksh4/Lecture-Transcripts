1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,319
Hi there, I'm Tucker Balch.

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:05,700
I'm here with Tammer Kamel,
he's founder of Quandl.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,330
We're here at Quantcon, which is
a conference organized by Quantopian.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,672
So I want to talk with you now about
your experience advising hedge funds.

5
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:23,064
I guess you have some experience
actually managing money.

6
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:27,878
And students in the class are really
interested to hear about real

7
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:32,830
live strategies that succeeded or
failed or lessons learned.

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,410
So what is jump diffusion?

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,643
>> The jump diffusion
was a model to try and

10
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:43,110
capture the sixth sigma event.

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,026
And the idea here was,
it was a smart idea, and

12
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:50,248
I can't take credit for it entirely.

13
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:54,024
But the idea here was if you
mix normal distributions and

14
00:00:54,024 --> 00:00:57,090
drew from them at
different probabilities.

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,958
So for example, you had a distribution
with volatility of sigma.

16
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,301
>> I think I know what you're talking
about, but I just want to review it,

17
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:05,269
in case folks there, so they can follow.

18
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,562
So you might have a distribution of
returns for one strategy or one stock.

19
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:10,202
>> Right.

20
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:15,150
>> And so you're talking about
the distributions for maybe different

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,154
strategies or different stocks and then
potentially combining them in some way.

22
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:21,771
>> Yeah, exactly.

23
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:24,590
>> And everybody assumes those
distributions are Gaussian, right?

24
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,016
So the bell curve-
>> Right.

25
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:30,800
And so, Gaussian distributions are so
delightful to work with, right?

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,803
>> [LAUGH]
>> So,

27
00:01:31,803 --> 00:01:35,490
the problem is that reality doesn't
intersect with them that much, right?

28
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,330
But one nice thing you can do is you can
actually simulate reality a little bit

29
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,198
better if you use not one, but
two Gaussian distributions.

30
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:46,861
And as your random variable moves,

31
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:50,954
you draw usually from
the first normal distribution.

32
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:53,276
But then with some random probability,

33
00:01:53,276 --> 00:01:57,450
you draw from a distribution with
a much higher standard deviation.

34
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,666
Thus simulating these rare events and
creates the fatter tails, and

35
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,116
is great for risk management.

36
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:07,580
It's predicted power is minimal,
because it's random so you don't.

37
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,961
But for risk management it really gives
you a much better sense of the fact

38
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:11,995
that- [CROSSTALK]
>> So

39
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:15,073
you might have a current portfolio and

40
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:21,048
do some sort of Monte Carlo simulation
to see how risky that portfolio is.

41
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:22,081
>> That's exactly the use case.

42
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:22,743
>> Gotcha, gotcha.

43
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,347
Okay, okay.

44
00:02:23,347 --> 00:02:28,886
So in one of your earlier careers
[LAUGH], you advised hedge funds.

45
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:34,191
What sorts of strategies did
your company generate and

46
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:36,875
advise the hedge funds on?

47
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:41,645
>> So I graduated from an engineering
program at the university in

48
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:42,817
the mid 90s.

49
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:46,330
And I always call this sort of the
golden age of quantitative financing.

50
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,578
It was an era when Wall Street was
plucking young vulnerable engineers

51
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:52,264
like myself,
>> [LAUGH]

52
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:54,948
>> And having us mathematically

53
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:56,456
model markets.

54
00:02:56,456 --> 00:03:01,450
And back then there was all
kinds of really fat opportunity.

55
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,738
The first thing we used to do was-
>> Anybody with a computer could make

56
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:05,500
money, right?

57
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,232
[LAUGH]
>> Well if you could do a bit of math

58
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:08,239
you really could, right.

59
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,409
There was this thing, we made a lot
of money on was yield per arbitrage.

60
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:18,211
>> If you did just a [CROSSTALK]
model the swap curve, for

61
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:22,264
example, with a two or
three factor model.

62
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:25,853
And you would discover, a,
that at any given time,

63
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:29,853
some deviation between a sensible
looking yield curve and

64
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:30,728
what was-
>> So

65
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:34,789
a particular asset would be currently
priced in a such a way to be contrary to

66
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,798
what the yield curve would predict?

67
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:41,208
>> What it would come down to is it
would be mis-priced relative to its

68
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,589
peers on that yield curve, right?

69
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:47,370
And backtesting would tell you,
would confirm that time and again,

70
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,036
that anomaly would revert back
to something more normal, right?

71
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:55,510
So you could make a lot of money by
taking these reasonably sophisticated

72
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,060
yield curve positions.

73
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,081
Where you were long at two points of
the curve, and short at two other

74
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:03,636
points of the curve, and you get these
funky butterfly kind of trades, right?

75
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:06,615
But they'd be sort of neutral
to the level of the curve, and

76
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:10,012
even neutral to the slope of the curve,
but there's these third and

77
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:12,820
fourth factors that would
be in revert all the time.

78
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,882
>> So, to take a short
position in a fixed income,

79
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:20,857
you would have to be
a credit swap of some sort?

80
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:22,390
Or how would you do that?

81
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,660
>> Many ways you can do that.

82
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,130
Credit swap certainly does it.

83
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,120
There was no such thing as a credit
swap when we were doing this.

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,283
You could short a government bond,
borrow it and

85
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:33,064
sell it in the repo market?

86
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:37,365
>> I just think of with the way you
can trade today electronically,

87
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:41,599
you never really think about
the borrowing and the reselling.

88
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,678
>> Right we used to
worry about that stuff.

89
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:44,419
Yeah repo rates, and all of that.

90
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,229
But yeah, that's been extracted
away to some extent, right?

91
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:49,133
But yeah, that's how we used to do it.

92
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,954
>> But, so you talked about
looking at yield curves.

93
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:55,150
Did you all do anything in equities?

94
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,583
Or was it just primarily
the fixed income?

95
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:01,532
>> We did, also in the 90s, stat arb and

96
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:09,090
even simple pair trades were very
effective trading strategies, right?

97
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,698
There was a lot more
inter-stock volatility.

98
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:17,249
A lot less correlation between the
stocks, at least until the late 90s and

99
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,170
the crash.

100
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,190
And you could even do more sophisticated
stuff like the stat arp stuff or

101
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,830
eigenvalue PCA analysis
on stock markets and

102
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,980
do sort of payer trading
strategies on these.

103
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,010
>> So a lot of that stuff
doesn't work anymore.

104
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,553
>> No it doesn't.

105
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:33,374
>> [LAUGH]
>> That's why I started a data company.

106
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,547
>> I see, okay.

107
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:39,764
Anyways, I wanted to ask
to what do you attribute

108
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:45,880
the evaporation of alpha and
these kinds of approaches?

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,340
>> I think there's a lot of
interesting things going on, right?

110
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,530
There's no question that
the number of participants

111
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,190
executing similar
strategies is a factor.

112
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,238
Volatility is low these days, right?

113
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:04,010
And these strategies thrive in high
volatility environments, right?

114
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,281
Like the 90s was a much higher
volatility environment,

115
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,558
even in a bull market.

116
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:13,112
Another big advantage we had in the 90s
was the phenomenon of the day trader,

117
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:16,569
which was for lack of a better term,
incompetent trading.

118
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:17,358
>> Right.

119
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:21,562
>> Right, which would create all kinds
of wacky, if the day traders woke up on

120
00:06:21,562 --> 00:06:25,260
a Tuesday morning and they were
all in love with Ebay for example.

121
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,530
Then everybody just went and
bought that, and

122
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,440
it would create a mispricing in Ebay,
right?

123
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,771
But what you don't have irrational
actors in the marketplace,

124
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:38,048
it makes these relative value
pair trades are harder to adapt.

125
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:41,348
>> And I guess at that time maybe the
day traders were a higher percentage of

126
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:42,344
the volume, right?

127
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:46,205
>> It was definitely a large
fraction of the volume, or

128
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,939
a meaningful faction of the volume.

129
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:49,623
>> Taking food from children's mouths.

130
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:53,020
[LAUGH]
>> So if someone were,

131
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,757
some young whipper snapper
wants to go out and

132
00:06:57,757 --> 00:07:03,119
start creating some kind
of systematic strategy,

133
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:06,748
is there any alpha left out there?

134
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:10,550
Or where should somebody
like that start?

135
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,850
>> Oh, I'm sure there's all
kinds of alpha to be had.

136
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,380
It's just you have to, don't look
in the same old places because

137
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,020
everybody already has been there and
there's only a bit.

138
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,780
I think there is all kinds

139
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,100
of opportunity if you find
new information sources.

140
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,710
You hear great stories about
little creative ideas where

141
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,420
you pay someone sitting in China to
count trucks coming out of a factory.

142
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,840
>> Right, right.
>> Right, you've heard this one.

143
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,260
And then you get a sense of how
production is going for that company.

144
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,308
Very simple little
information advantage.

145
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:46,924
>> Right.

146
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,306
Mechanical Turk like sorts of things.

147
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:49,467
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

148
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:50,830
There's all kinds of things
you can do with that.

149
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,170
>> So I think that's fascinating.

150
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,760
The one thing I would say to sort
of reinforce the kind of thing

151
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,350
that Quandl can offer is we often
find that the combination of

152
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,490
different data sources adds value.

153
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,878
So as an example, maybe over simplified.

154
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:12,868
Back in the 90s, a strategy,
say based on Bollinger Bands,

155
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:18,380
might have worked when you hit
the top that could be a cell signal.

156
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,834
Nowadays, that just by itself,
it doesn't work.

157
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:26,675
[LAUGH] But, a combination of multiple
technical indicators plus some

158
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:31,760
fundamental data, putting all those
together instead of just a simple,

159
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,905
single factor model can work.

160
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:34,881
>> Yeah, I know, I think so.

161
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,522
I still have,
there's three rules of thumb for

162
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:40,240
building quantitative
strategies these days.

163
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,360
I think one should look for
theoretically sound ideas.

164
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,700
So don't bet on black box,
neural net, kind of things,

165
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,460
because they always fall down, right?

166
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,465
But if something makes theoretical sense
in an economics or financial sense,

167
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:57,783
it's a good chance
you're onto something.

168
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:01,530
>> So it's a good intuitive
story to start with.

169
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,250
>> Exactly,

170
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,990
it actually should make sense on
a whiteboard to start with, right?

171
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,480
Grounded in some of the fundamental

172
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,990
principals that we know govern
financial markets in economics right?

173
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,960
Number two is empirically tested, right?

174
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,392
So build something that's
theoretically sound and

175
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:19,716
then show yourself empirically,
with data, that this thing worked.

176
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:22,596
And then the final thing
is be scared of complexity.

177
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:28,239
If it doesn't stay simple its a warning
sign your probably over fitting and

178
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:30,990
getting yourself into a trap.

179
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,224
But if you devise a strategy
that ticks these three boxes,

180
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:38,978
that it's sort of theoretically sound,
empirically testable, and still simple,

181
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,105
you're probably on the right track.

182
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:41,802
>> Yeah.

183
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:42,742
[LAUGH] That's great.

184
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:43,984
I'm in total agreement with you.

185
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,120
So, one last question.

186
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,610
So we've talked about things to do or
how to attack it.

187
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,760
What should people run from,
[LAUGH] what should they be scared of?

188
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,530
>> Look I think the single biggest trap,
and I've fallen into this thing myself,

189
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,730
right, is if you find yourself
calibrating the same model

190
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,519
on the same data usually,
and you calibrate it.

191
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,742
Oh, it doesn't quite work.

192
00:10:06,742 --> 00:10:09,710
And then you turn a few knobs and
it doesn't quite work.

193
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,630
And then the eighth time
you finally turn the knobs

194
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,793
just right and it's working?

195
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:18,239
Odds are you've just curve fitted,
right?.

196
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:23,020
Don't fall into that trap of
endlessly iterating on the same data.

197
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,802
Because you're in for

198
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:29,685
unpleasant surprises once you get into,
out of sample data.

199
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:31,205
>> Great.
Yeah.

200
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:34,959
[LAUGH] You're totally going to
reinforce the things I say in the class,

201
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,317
so that's awesome, but

202
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:39,246
they don't believe it when
they hear it just from me.

203
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:39,907
>> Trust me.

204
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:42,566
I've lost a lot of my [LAUGH]
>> Cool.

205
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:43,785
Well that's it.

206
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:45,166
Fantastic, great interview.

207
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,503
Thanks so much for your time Tammer.

208
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:47,523
>> The pleasure was mine Tucker,
thank you.

209
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:52,500
>> And hope you all enjoyed it and
I'll see you online.

210
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,000
So long.
