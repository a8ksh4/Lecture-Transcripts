00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,290
We've identified that we want to use
these three historical data points

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,870
in order to answer our query about
how much rain we would expect if

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,400
barometric pressure
drops five millimeters.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,790
But what should we do with these
data points to find that prediction?

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,600
Here are three alternatives for
you to consider.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,810
Take your time and check which one
