00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,550
So I'd like you to consider two data
sets, and think about whether it

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,500
would be best to use a parametric
model or a non-parametric model.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,230
Our first problem is a cannon,
and we orient the cannon up or

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,450
down a certain number of degrees,
and we want to estimate based on

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,740
how many degrees up or down it is how
far is the cannonball going to go.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,183
The cannon's oriented at
a certain angle, boom,

7
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:35,279
the cannonball comes out, and
it follows some trajectory like this,

8
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:40,236
and [SOUND] splats over here,
so this angle theta is our x,

9
00:00:40,236 --> 00:00:44,300
and this distance,
how far it went, is our y.

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,875
And so we take the cannon,
we orient it at many different thetas,

11
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,780
and we measure how far
the cannonball goes.

12
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,430
And that's our data.

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,110
Here's another problem
from animal behavior.

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,960
Let's suppose we have a beehive, and

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,590
we want to estimate
the behavior of the bees.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,160
In other words, how many of them
will be attracted to this food

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,280
source as richness of
the food source increases?

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,460
So in other words, our x is
the richness of the food source, and

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,270
our y is how many.

20
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,720
So the reason this is a different
sort of problem than,

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,990
say, that cannonball problem,
is it's not clear that as we

22
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,570
increase the richness of the food,
that necessarily more bees will come.

23
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,940
Consider these two problems.

24
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,350
The cannonball problem, we're trying to
build a model for how far will the canon

25
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:44,400
ball go depending on what is x,
the angle at which the barrel is aimed.

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,320
And the honeybee problem, how many
honeybees will visit a food source

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,890
as we change the richness of the food
source from, say, poor to rich.

28
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,930
Do you think this problem is best
solved by a parametric model,

29
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,900
or non-parametric model for each one?

30
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,600
So go ahead and enter your guesses and

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,460
I'll tell you what I
think the answer is.
