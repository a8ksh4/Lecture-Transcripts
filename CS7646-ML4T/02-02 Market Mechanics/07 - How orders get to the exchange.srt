1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,426
We've talked about what orders are and

2
00:00:02,426 --> 00:00:06,467
we've talked about what happens to
them when they get to the exchange.

3
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:12,240
Let's talk now about how do the orders
get to the exchange from you.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,171
Well, here you are with your laptop
connected to the internet and

5
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:19,111
you've just entered
an order to buy some stock.

6
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:22,426
Your buy order goes over
the internet to your broker.

7
00:00:22,426 --> 00:00:26,110
Your broker in turn is connected
to several exchanges and

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,181
the broker determines
where to route your order

9
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:33,310
based on information it
knows about the exchanges.

10
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,210
Let's suppose the exchanges we're
looking at are New York Stock Exchange,

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,090
NASDAQ and BATS.

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,840
For the stocks you want to buy,

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,851
each one of these exchanges
has its own order book.

14
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:48,150
Your broker has a computer located
at each exchange and it queries

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,323
the computer to say, hey, look at the
order book and tell me the prices there.

16
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:56,594
Query has added all the exchanges and
your broker gathers and

17
00:00:56,594 --> 00:00:59,098
examines that information and
based on that,

18
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:02,257
routes your order to the exchange
that has the best price.

19
00:01:02,257 --> 00:01:04,424
Let's say that's
New York Stock Exchange.

20
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:09,791
Your order enters the exchange,
gets executed and the price comes back

21
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:14,904
to your broker and forwarded back
to you and you get a confirmation.

22
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:19,099
Now it turns out that because this is
happening constantly all the time,

23
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:22,265
there's multiple brokers,
hundreds of thousands,

24
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:25,498
millions of people making
orders that the order books at

25
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:28,560
each of these exchanges
tends to be pretty similar.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,568
In other words,

27
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:33,605
the prices don't differ much between
one or another and it's this

28
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:38,450
sort of pressure that keeps prices the
same across these different exchanges.

29
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,270
Let's consider another scenario.

30
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,238
Suppose there's another client
of this same brokerage, Joe and

31
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,866
that Joe wants to sell some stock.

32
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:52,334
Well, the brokerage can observe, hey,
I've got some clients who want to sell,

33
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:53,923
some clients who want to buy.

34
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:56,497
I can just make that
exchange internally and

35
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:58,939
I don't even need to
go to the exchanges.

36
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:03,160
This can be advantageous for the broker,
because a broker doesn't have to

37
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,586
pay now fees to the exchanges for
this transaction to occur.

38
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:10,020
However, according to the law,
both the seller and

39
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,846
the buyer have to get prices that
are at least as good as they

40
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:17,143
would've gotten if they
had gone to an exchange.

41
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:19,507
And eventually, at the end of the day,

42
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:23,456
this transaction has to be registered
with one of the exchanges.

43
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:28,851
Usually, it's recorded at the exchange
where that particular stock is homed.

44
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:31,133
Let's consider one more example.

45
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:34,538
In this case,
Lisa also wants to sell some stock, but

46
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:37,120
she uses a different broker than you do.

47
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,910
There's one more kind of entity
out there called a Dark Pool

48
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,590
that acts as an intermediary
between brokerages and exchanges.

49
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,950
So the Dark Pool is looking at the order
books of the various exchanges and

50
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,753
they're often making predictions about
which direction stocks are going to go.

51
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:57,697
They actually pay the brokers for

52
00:02:57,697 --> 00:03:01,663
the privilege to look at the orders
before they go to the exchanges.

53
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:05,553
And if they see an advantageous trade,
they'll go ahead and take it.

54
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:10,026
So in this case,
this cell might be routed through

55
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:13,973
the Dark Pool from broker
two to broker one.

56
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:18,231
And again, the transaction never
makes it to the exchanges.

57
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,294
In fact, these days,
80 to 90% of what they

58
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:25,050
call retail traders orders
never make it to the exchanges.

59
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,950
They're either executed
internally within a brokerage or

60
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,106
filled using a Dark Pool.

61
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:36,601
The brokerages in the Dark Pools
argue that, that's just fine,

62
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:41,422
because both partners in this
transaction are getting prices at least

63
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:45,604
as good as they would get at
the exchanges on the order books.

64
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:49,330
But they're saving money, because they
don't have to pay the exchange fees.

65
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,590
We've talked so
far about how the exchanges work and

66
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,520
how the order book facilitates
transactions at the exchanges.

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,060
Now we've talked about how
orders get to exchanges or not.

68
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,940
Now, lets take a look at how hedge funds

69
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,240
can exploit inefficiencies
in this system.
