1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,435
The answer is $1000.

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,780
For each $1 the stock drops in price,

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,890
you make $100 because
you've got 100 shares.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,520
So altogether,
the stock dropped in price $10,

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,639
you had 100 shares so
your net return is $1000.
