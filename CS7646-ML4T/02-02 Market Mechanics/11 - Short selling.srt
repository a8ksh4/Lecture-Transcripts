1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,650
Let's suppose you've been watching IBM.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,840
It's reached about $100, and

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,550
you'd like to short it because
you think it's going to go down.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,920
Suppose you shorted it right
here when its price was $100.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,900
Now you're in that short position.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,040
You watch the stock for a few days.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,080
It goes down to $90, and
you decide, okay, I want to exit.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,630
So you submit an order to your
broker to close out your position

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,700
by buying out those 100 shares and
you do it at $90.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,660
The question is, what's your net return?

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,759
Did you make money?

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,600
Did you lose money?

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,970
What's the total return in dollars of
this transaction where you short 100

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,999
shares when it's at $100 and
you buy to close when it's at $90?
