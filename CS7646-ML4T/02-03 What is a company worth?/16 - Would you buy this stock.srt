00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,710
So let's go back to
that original question.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,694
Assuming this company has
a book value of $80 million,

3
00:00:06,694 --> 00:00:11,360
an intrinsic value of $20 million,
and a market cap of $75 million.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:19,480
And by the way this means that you can
buy the entire company for $75 million.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,283
Our question is,
would you buy this stock?

6
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:31,270
And more specifically, would you buy
this whole company for $75 million.

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,130
Yes or no, would you buy this stock?
