00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,120
I'd like to show you
this cool machine I have.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,217
In fact it's one of my most prized
possessions that my great uncle gave to

3
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:08,703
me before he passed away.

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:16,178
Let's pretend that this
machine represents a company,

5
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:19,140
and that I'm the CEO of that company.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,500
This company can take raw
materials like this paper, and

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,950
process them, and
turn them into dollars.

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:28,866
Here's how it works.

9
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:40,150
So, each year, this company can
output a dollar bill reliably.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,310
What is this company worth?
