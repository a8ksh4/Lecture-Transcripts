1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,070
Consider this example for
the 2 and 20 situation.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,630
Assume you're a hedge fund manager and

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,827
that you've been managing a fund of
$100 million, and that over the course

4
00:00:11,827 --> 00:00:16,968
of a year your skill has resulted in an
increase in value of that fund by 15%.

5
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:22,866
So over that year, the fund grew in
value from 100 million to 115 million.

6
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:25,127
What would you're compensation be?

7
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:31,137
So it's 2% of AUM plus 20% of profit.

8
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:35,410
The two component works
out to be $2 million.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,330
The 20 component is 20%
of the $15 million profit

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,270
we made which is 3 million.

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,920
So total compensation for this year for

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,090
the hedge fund manager would
be about five million dollars.

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,695
Now one question that some people might
have is, hey is this two component

14
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:58,960
2% of 100 million or 2% of 115,

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,300
and it depends on
the hedge fund of course.

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,630
And it depends on when they take
snap shots to do accounting.

17
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,140
The full answer is
probably it's going to be

18
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,680
a blend somewhere between
100 million and 115 million.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,770
This structure Two and
Twenty has been assailed lately

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,730
and it's very rare now to find a hedge
fund that offers rates that high.

21
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,680
They're much lower now.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,430
One and Ten.

23
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,010
Things like that.

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,474
So the Two and Twenty was in the heyday
of hedge funds in the 90s and

25
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,180
early 2000s.

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,780
Nowadays they are typically
a little bit lower.

27
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,267
There are some Star hedge
funds that charge more.

28
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:53,316
For instance, ASC Capital, which is no
longer operating to the public anyways,

29
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:57,830
that charge as much as 40%,
so it was 4 and 40.

30
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,676
However, most hedge funds you find
today will be somewhere between Two and

31
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:02,600
Twenty or lower.
