1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,010
So, when an investor is considering
a particular hedge fund,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,480
they want to know,
what are the goals for the hedge fund?

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,800
And they'll also want to know
the results of certain metrics.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,150
Let's take a look at goals first.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,750
Now, you might say, of course,
my goal is to make money.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,750
Well, it's a little bit finer than that,
or a little bit more subtle than that.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,200
There are, of course,
other potential goals, but

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,020
these two are the primary types of
goals that hedge funds go after.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,960
One type is to beat a benchmark.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,580
What does that mean?

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,850
Let's suppose, for instance, that you've
got a strategy that looks at the stocks

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,945
that are in the S&P 500,
there's 500 of them of course and

13
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:49,310
you're especially smart at
picking out the good ones.

14
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:54,172
So you might build a hedge fund
who's goal is to beat the S&P

15
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:59,420
500 index as a benchmark because
you're wise at selecting

16
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,490
among all those,
which stocks are going to outperform?

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:09,010
And, of course, the over all index has
the good stocks and the bad stocks,

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,030
so you're going to do better because
you picked the specific good ones.

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,653
An important component of
the benchmark model is

20
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:21,390
that many benchmarks,
like the stock market as a whole, for

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,460
which S&P 500 is a good representative,
go down.

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,750
And it is of course natural
that a portfolio consisted of

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,180
stocks from this index
might go down as well.

24
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,470
So, even though both the index and
the fund go down,

25
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,750
you can outperform the index
by going down less.

26
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,160
So, this kind of fund that is
tagged against a benchmark

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,670
can still meet performance
goals if it goes down.

28
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,410
So long as that index
is going down more.

29
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,870
That brings us to absolute return funds.

30
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,550
Their goal is to provide
positive return no matter what.

31
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,330
These funds are usually long/short,

32
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,770
which means they make positive bets in
stocks they think are going to go up.

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,050
And they make negative bets in
stocks are going to go down.

34
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,670
We'll talk about shorting
a little bit later.

35
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,180
In any case there objective is to make

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,580
slow gradual positive
return no matter what.

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,560
Often, these types of funds don't
make the same percentage gains

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,550
as the beat a benchmark fund, but
they have very low draw downs.

39
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,030
In other words, when the market
takes a bit hit, they often don't.

40
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,430
The next question is well,

41
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:44,060
how do we measure how well that
fund is meeting those goals?

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,190
We talked about these
metrics in the mini course

43
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,700
manipulating financial data in Python,
but

44
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,460
we'll repeat it just a little bit here
to remind you, and also to bring those

45
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,410
folks up to speed who didn't
necessarily have the previous course.

46
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,520
Cumulative return is a measure of,
given the funds I started with,

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,680
how much more did I end up with
after a certain amount of time?

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,240
So suppose we have and
in the array of values of our portfolio,

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,630
where zero is the first value, and
minus one is the very last one.

50
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,170
We can easily compute cumulative
return by dividing that last value

51
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,280
by the first value and subtracting one.

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,840
So for instance if we made 20% over
a year this would end up being 0.2.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,850
Volatility is a measure of how
rapidly and aggressively the portfolio

54
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,830
goes up and down in value and
of course lower volatility is better.

55
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:51,380
Volatility is simply measured as
the standard deviation of daily returns.

56
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,670
Our last factor here which is a measure
of the ratio of risk to reward is

57
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,500
typically measure using sharp ratio, and
the sharp ratio is calculated like this.

58
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,980
Sharp ratio is also sometimes
called risk adjusted reward.

59
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,070
So, you can consider that to
be reward divided by risk.

60
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:19,690
A reward is our average,
daily return minus the risk-free rate.

61
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,120
And our risk is simply a measure of that
standard deviation of daily returns or

62
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,630
volatility.

63
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,490
We multiply that ratio by
the square root of 252.

64
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,640
That is how many trading
days there are in a year and

65
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,940
remember we're always
working with daily returns.

66
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,270
So that's why we use this 252 number.

67
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,450
So recapping, hedge funds have goals,

68
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,400
typically either to meet a particular
bench mark or to gain absolute return.

69
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,580
And then metrics by which we judge
how well they accomplish those goals.

70
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,050
So, cumulative return, how much do
they make over a period of time?

71
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,900
Volatility, how volatile
were they over that time?

72
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,420
And then risk adjusted reward or
sharp ratio.

73
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,612
One thing I want to mention before
I leave this topic with regard to

74
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:14,990
benchmarks is the benchmark you choose
should depend on the expertise you have.

75
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,260
So let's suppose you're
an expert in Eastern Europe.

76
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,970
And you're great at picking stocks in
emerging markets in Eastern Europe.

77
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,910
You should select some
benchmark that represents

78
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,990
that similar kind of investing.

79
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,750
And there are indexes that represent
emerging markets in eastern Europe.

80
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,440
There are also other funds who's
values you might use as a benchmark or

81
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,190
let's say your expertise is in banks.

82
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,730
You might choose an index for
the banking industry and

83
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,750
show that you can beat that.
