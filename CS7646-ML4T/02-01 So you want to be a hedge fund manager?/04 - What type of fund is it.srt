00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,370
I want you to fire up your web browser,
and do a little bit of research.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,500
Take a look at either Yahoo Finance or
Google Finance, and

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,990
you'll find the answer to this question.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,970
I want you to look at each
of these five funds and

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,250
determine is it a ETF,
a mutual fund, or a hedge fund, and

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,940
fill in the text in each of these
little boxes with an E if it's an ETF,

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,270
an M if it's a mutual fund,
and an H if it's a hedge fund.

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,930
Again E, M or H.
