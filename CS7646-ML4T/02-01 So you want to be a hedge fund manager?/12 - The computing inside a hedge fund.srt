1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,580
Hedge funds are among the most
computationally demanding environments

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,910
I know of.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,420
They have infrastructure
requirements like huge databases,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,251
significant network connectivity,
low latency and

5
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:18,203
high bandwidth connectivity,
real-time processing, and so on.

6
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:22,853
I want to show you as an example,
the typical kinds of computing

7
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:27,520
that goes on inside a hedge fund
to motivate you for this class.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,119
In other words, this isn't exactly
the way all hedge funds work, but

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,740
this is just to give you a taste for
how many hedge funds work.

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,430
And you'll see, I think,
that computing and

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,230
computational capabilities
are core here.

12
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,720
So we're going to work
backwards from the market

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,150
back towards the sort of back
office of the hedge fund.

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:58,390
The way things work are we have
certain portfolio that is which stocks

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,640
we have and whether we're in positive or
negative positions with regard to them.

16
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,530
The trading algorithm here is central.

17
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,690
It's interacting with the market,
observing the live portfolio.

18
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,634
And what it's trying to do is
to get this live portfolio

19
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:20,280
to match some target portfolio.

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,390
So somewhere further back
inside the hedge fund

21
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,750
we've decided what this target
portfolio ought to look like.

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,760
In other words,

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,510
how many shares of Apple, how many
shares of Delta Airlines we should have,

24
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,720
and so on, and this trading
algorithm is trying to get us there.

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,550
So it's comparing target with live.

26
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,400
And then to move this portfolio towards
that target, it's issuing orders.

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,560
So it sends order like buy 200
shares of Apple to the market.

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,210
Those orders get executed or not,
and that updates the live portfolio.

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,550
Now one reason this kind of
trading algorithm is important

30
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,710
is you don't want to
execute everything at once.

31
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,760
In other words,
suppose we wanted to take a very,

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,620
very large position in Apple.

33
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:15,196
If we were just to send an order, hey,
buy me 10 million shares of Apple,

34
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:20,065
that would affect us detrimentally
in the sense that the price for

35
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:22,207
Apple would probably rise.

36
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:24,840
And we would not get a good execution.

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,450
So this training algorithm takes those
sorts of things into consideration as

38
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,070
it moves our live portfolio to be
more close to the target portfolio.

39
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,930
In fact, sometimes it takes days
to enter a particular position.

40
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,270
So this doesn't necessarily
happen all at once.

41
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,269
And there's many, many different
types of trading algorithms that have

42
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,980
been invented to solve these problems.

43
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,190
Now let's step one step back into
the computing of the hedgefund, and

44
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,416
look at how we arrive at
this target portfolio.

45
00:02:55,416 --> 00:03:00,292
Here's that target portfolio,
and here is some of the data and

46
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:05,268
computing that could go into
computing that target portfolio.

47
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:10,795
So from somewhere, machine learning
perhaps, we have a forecast

48
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:16,134
of what stock prices are going to
be at some time into the future.

49
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:21,440
And that can of course drive what our
target portfolio ought to be for today.

50
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,687
In other words, if we're forecasting
that BAC is going to go up,

51
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:31,541
this might represent that we
think it's going to go up 5%.

52
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:35,560
We might want to increase
our holdings in that.

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
If we think that Apple, for instance,

54
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,520
is going to go down,
we might want to decrease our holdings.

55
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,209
So this forecast informs this algorithm
called a Portfolio Optimizer.

56
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:52,036
That works to balance the risks and
rewards for

57
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:57,485
a balanced portfolio that
considers volatility and

58
00:03:57,485 --> 00:04:02,707
correlation between different stocks and
so on.

59
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:06,825
We're going to talk a lot about
portfolio optimization later in this

60
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:08,140
course.

61
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,607
Some other considerations that go into
Portfolio Optimizer are historical data,

62
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:16,351
open, high, low, close, and volume.

63
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:21,606
We can look at that historical data to
inform how stocks are correlated or

64
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:24,104
uncorrelated to one another, and

65
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:28,870
also of critical importance
is our current portfolio.

66
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,750
It may be the case that if we're
holding something, we don't

67
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,750
want to exit it immediately because
we'd be penalized by rapidly selling it.

68
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,690
So this optimizer takes all
this information into account

69
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,270
to get to the target portfolio

70
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,500
that our trading algorithm is
working to drive us towards.

71
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,770
Now one more stop along our road here at
the computing infrastructure of a hedge

72
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,420
fund is to look at how do we come
up with this N-day forecast.

73
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,860
By N, N might be five days or
ten days or whatever.

74
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,010
So here's this N-day forecast, and we've
got some kind of forecasting algorithm.

75
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,470
This is very often in
the form of a model, in fact,

76
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,630
a machine learning based model.

77
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,670
And creating these sorts of forecasting
algorithms using machine learning

78
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:25,390
is the focus of the last mini-course
in this group of mini-courses.

79
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,260
Anyhow, how do we get to this forecast?

80
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,980
Well, we've usually got some
sort of proprietary information,

81
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,380
again, historical data, and

82
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:41,080
our forecaster crunches all that data
to build a model and create a forecast.

83
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,800
So, bringing it all together,
that's the computing in a hedge fund.

84
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,820
And we've also spent some time
talking about what might motivate you

85
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,400
as a hedge fund manager.

86
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,630
That's it for this lesson.

87
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,830
I'll talk to you again soon.
