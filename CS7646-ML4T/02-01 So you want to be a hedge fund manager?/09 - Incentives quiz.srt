1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,980
With regard to accumulating
assets under management,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,270
the expense ratio approach really
most strongly motivates that.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,040
Although I wouldn't count too much off
if you also clicked two and twenty

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,810
because of course the two part of two
and twenty is assets under management.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,100
But, if you were strictly
driven by expense ratio,

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,970
you're going to be applying most of your
energy towards accumulating assets so

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,860
that you'll have a higher return.

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,820
In other words, as a portfolio manager,
you'll get more money.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,390
Profits are different, ETF's and

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,189
mutual fund managers are not
compensated for making profit.

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,940
Especially when you consider,
say, ETFs, exchange traded funds.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,200
They're just supposed to track
a particular asset or index, and

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,250
they should be good at that.

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,610
It's not up to them whether
that index goes up or down.

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,470
So two and twenty is the structure
that most compensates for profit

16
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,190
because it has this twenty component
that is indeed part of that profit.

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,730
With regard to risk taking,
an expense ratio

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,430
based fund really is not
incentivized to take risks at all.

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,870
If they take risks,
there's no compensation for it.

20
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,370
Under the two and twenty model though,
they are incentivized to take risks

21
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,230
because that's how they
can get to profits.

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,470
Also, because they're always
going to get this two percent,

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,170
even if they take huge risks and

24
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,060
don't make a profit, they're always
going to get that two percent.

25
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,250
So they're incentivized
to take a risk because A,

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,990
there's not too much of a penalty and
B, if they take a risk and

27
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,870
make profits,
then they'll be compensated more.
