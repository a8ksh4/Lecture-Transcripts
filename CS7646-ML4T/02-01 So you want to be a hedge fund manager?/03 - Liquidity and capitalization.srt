1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,580
I mentioned a couple words while I
was describing these different kinds

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,510
of funds that I wanted to
touch on real quickly.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,050
I said liquid a couple times.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,030
What that means is the ease
with which one can buy or

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,920
sell shares in a particular holding.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,655
Stocks are extremely liquid.

7
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:22,790
ETFs are liquid in the same way,
in other words

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,170
you can go to a stock exchange,
you can buy an ETF and sell an ETF.

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,220
It's priced just like a stock,
but when you buy it,

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:36,530
you're buying shares of multiple
stocks instead of just a single stock.

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,742
But ETFs are liquid because
they're easy to trade.

12
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:46,910
They're also liquid in many
cases because there's so

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,810
much dollar value trading
in them each day.

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,600
If you look up an ETF on
say Google Finance or

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,360
Yahoo Finance, you can see how
much volume is traded each day.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,200
And ETFs with higher volumes
are even more liquid.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,440
I mentioned large cap.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,980
What cap means here is capitalization or
in other words,

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,970
how much is the company
worth according to

20
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,360
number of shares that are outstanding,
times the price of the stock.

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,088
So, some really huge cap stocks,

22
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:32,020
say like Apple are worth many,
many billions of dollars.

23
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,340
So when I say large cap stocks,
that's what I'm referring to.

24
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,000
There's also small cap stocks that
are similarly, have lower value.

25
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,350
And one thing to mention as long as
we're on this topic, is the price of

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,540
a stock really only relates to
what one share is selling at.

27
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,430
It doesn't relate to the overall
value of the company.

28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,500
We'll get into all of these
topics a little bit later.

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,290
Now to recap, there are at least
these three types of funds.

30
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,510
There are electronically traded funds,

31
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,400
which you can trade like
stocks on a stock market.

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,100
There's mutual funds, that
are a little bit harder to get in and

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,900
out of, but
you can trade them on a daily basis.

34
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,530
You usually have to go
through a specific broker.

35
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,320
You can't just trade them on your own,
and

36
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,000
finally hedge funds require a specific
agreement to trade into or out of.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay, those are the three
major types of funds.
