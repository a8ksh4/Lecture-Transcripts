1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,400
As I mentioned, we're assuming that you
want to be a portfolio manager of some

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,610
sort and there are several different
sorts of portfolios you might manage.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,830
So let's take a look at a few of those.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,450
There are many different types of funds,
of course, but

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,702
three broad classes that we'll
take a look at are ETFs or

6
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:23,880
exchange-traded funds,
mutual funds, and hedge funds.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,626
Let's look at the differences
between these.

8
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,610
ETFs, or exchange-traded funds,

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,390
are very much like stocks in the sense
that you can buy and sell them.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,350
You can observe their prices intraday.

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,980
You can trade them just like
stocks on the stock exchange.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,600
They represent baskets of stocks.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,630
Sometimes they represent other
instruments like bonds and so on.

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:51,630
But it's very well-known and
they publish what it is they're holding.

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,470
Accordingly, ETFs are very
transparent and they're very liquid.

16
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,720
Mutual funds are somewhat similar
to ETFs in the sense that they have

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,370
a declared goal or mechanism.

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,430
In other words, they're, for instance,
trying to track the S&P 500 or

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,250
some other such goal, but
they're a little bit different.

20
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,000
First of all, you can only buy or
sell mutual funds at the end of the day.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,090
So at the end of the day they add
up all the things they hold and

22
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,120
compute a net asset value, and

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,090
that's the value at which you can buy or
sell shares of a mutual fund.

24
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,120
They don't disclose exactly what they're
holding except once every quarter, so

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,800
they're accordingly less transparent.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,310
They're less transparent because
since their last disclosure,

27
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,050
you don't know exactly what
they might have bought or sold.

28
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,133
Still, they're somewhat transparent
because they have stated goals and

29
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:53,500
you know what they're trying to achieve,
similar to, say,

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,976
an ETF that might represent the S&P 500.

31
00:01:55,976 --> 00:02:00,776
There are also mutual funds
that represent large cap stocks

32
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:02,606
like the S&P 500.

33
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:07,090
Hedge funds are even less
transparent than mutual funds.

34
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,830
In fact,
even to buy shares in a hedge fund,

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,354
you have to enter into an agreement
that is usually secret in

36
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:18,410
the sense that you're not supposed to
reveal the contents of that agreement.

37
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,310
It's hard to exit a hedge fund.

38
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,950
They usually require you
to put your money in and

39
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,950
leave it there for some number
of months, sometimes years, and

40
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,040
when you take it out, you can't
necessarily take it out all at once.

41
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,280
Hedge funds don't ever have to
disclose what they're holding,

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,320
not even to the investors
in the hedge funds.

43
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,490
Now, that might dissuade
you from wanting, say,

44
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,570
to invest in it if you don't
know what they're holding.

45
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,270
On the other hand, you know,

46
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,580
if they show you a good performance,
you might want to invest.

47
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,440
They will usually describe to clients
what their strategy is and so

48
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,650
on to encourage clients to invest.

49
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,620
Accordingly, hedge funds
are not transparent at all.
