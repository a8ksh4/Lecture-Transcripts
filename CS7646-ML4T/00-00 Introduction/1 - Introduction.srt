00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,530
Hi there, I'm Tucker Balch.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,350
I'm a professor at Georgia Tech and
I'm the instructor for this course.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,565
>> Hi, I'm Devpriya Dave,
a graduate student at Georgia Tech.

4
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:10,562
You can call me Dev.

5
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:14,049
>> My original research was about
machine learning for robotics,

6
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:19,270
but in 2007 I became interested in using
these same algorithms for investing.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,240
Since that time I've shifted my
research and teaching towards finance.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,420
I also cofounded a financial technology
company called Lucena Research.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,660
>> I'm a graduate student who's
been working with Professor to

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,840
built up predictive system for
stock market.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,050
I'm also working on the software
to support this course.

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,810
>> You're going to see a lot
of Dev in this course.

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,230
She makes a lot of things
happen behind the scenes.

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,680
Now Dev,
I'm thinking about buying Apple stock.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,330
Do you think I should do it?

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,810
>> Mm, well,
it depends on a lot of factors.

17
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,880
What are the other stocks
in your portfolio?

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,750
What do you think will
predict stock prices?

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,660
Also, how much risk do you
think you can take it on?

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,190
>> So those are all good questions,
and Dev is exactly right.

21
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,290
We need to consider all of those
things before we make an investment.

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,102
Now in this course we're going
to cover a lot of these issues.

23
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:11,483
We're going to show you how information
influences the movement of a stock

24
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:16,430
price, how to build software to analyze
and visualize these relationships, and

25
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,450
details about how
the stock exchanges work.

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,120
Finally, in the last section
of this course we're going to

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,610
show you how to build
machine learning algorithms

28
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,120
that you can use to build
real trading strategies.

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,130
Now let's get started.

30
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:30,720
>> Let's do it.
