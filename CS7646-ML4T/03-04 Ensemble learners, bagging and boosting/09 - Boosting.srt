00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,250
Boosting is a fairly simple variation
on bagging that strives to improve

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,170
the learners by focusing on areas where
the system is not performing well.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,060
One of the most well-known algorithms
in this area is called ada boost.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,460
And I believe it's ada,
not ata because ada stands for adaptive.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,680
Here's how ada boost works.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,420
We build our first bag of
data in the usual way.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,670
We select randomly
from our training data.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,880
We then train a model in a usual way.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,430
The next thing we do, and
this is something different,

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,150
we take all our training data and
use it to test the model

11
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,975
in order to discover that
some of the points in here,

12
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:46,060
our x's and our y's,
are not well predicted.

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,500
So there's going to be
some points in here for

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,503
which there is significant error.

15
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:56,660
Now, when we go to build our
next bag of data, again,

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,550
we choose randomly
from our original data.

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,300
But each instance is weighted
according to this error.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,850
So, these points that had significant
error, are more likely to get picked and

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,832
to go into this bag than any
other individual instance.

20
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:16,900
So as you see, we ended up with
a few of those points in here and

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,220
a smattering of all
the other ones as well.

22
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,980
We build a model from this data and
then we test it.

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,460
Now we test our system altogether.

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,760
In other words, we've got a sort
of miniature ensemble here,

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,560
just two learners.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,420
And we test both of them.

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,360
We test them by inputting
again this in-sample data.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,430
We test on each instance and
we combine their outputs.

29
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,720
And again we measure error
across all this data.

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,780
Maybe this time these points
got modeled better, but

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,820
there were some other ones up
here that weren't as good.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,760
And thus we build our next bag and
our next model.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,750
And we just continue this over,
and over and

34
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,090
over again up until m or
the total number of bags we'll be using.

35
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,720
So to recap, bagging,
when we build one of these instances,

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,770
is simply choosing some subset of
the data at random with replacement,

37
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,490
and we create each bag in the same way.

38
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:18,870
Boosting is an add-on to this idea where
in subsequent bags we choose those

39
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,280
data instances that had been modeled
poorly in the overall system before.
