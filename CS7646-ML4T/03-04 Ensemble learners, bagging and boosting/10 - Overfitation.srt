1
00:00:00,222 --> 00:00:03,060
All right, so I want you to think back
over what we've been talking about,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,170
bagging and add a boost.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,520
Which is more likely to
overfit as m increases?

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,920
Now keep in mind that m is the number
of bags that we're using, or

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,430
the number of models that we're
building to create our ensemble.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,410
So as m increases,
which one is more likely to overfit?
