1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,619
Okay.
So, let's take a look at some real

2
00:00:02,619 --> 00:00:04,360
stock data.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,440
We provide for
you in this class hundreds of CSV files

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,620
that represent the prices
of stocks over time.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,190
Here's an example from one of
those files that you provided.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,600
This is data from the file HCP.csv.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,936
So, here is our header row and

8
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:25,855
here is the information that
you'll find in one of these files.

9
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:30,597
So, Date,
which date is the information for?

10
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:34,649
Open, this is the price
that the stock opened at.

11
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,204
In other words, in the morning,
when trading on the exchange began,

12
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:42,460
that was the first price of the day for
that stock.

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,080
High, throughout the day,
what was the very high price,

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,950
what was the very low price, and
at which price did the stock close?

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,330
So when we reached 4 o'clock,
what was the final price?

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,594
Volume, that's how many shares of
the stock traded altogether on that day.

17
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:07,573
And finally, this value, adjusted close,

18
00:01:07,573 --> 00:01:11,457
which is a little bit
different from close.

19
00:01:11,457 --> 00:01:17,430
And this is something we cover in the
next course where we talk about finance.

20
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,290
I'll talk about it a little bit here,
as well.

21
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,998
But let me delay talking about it for
a moment.

22
00:01:23,998 --> 00:01:26,620
Okay.
I fleshed out this data a little bit.

23
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:34,362
First thing I want you to notice is that
the dates start with most recent dates,

24
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:40,597
and then as you go forward into
the file, you find older dates.

25
00:01:40,597 --> 00:01:42,485
So, what that means, more or

26
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:47,140
less, is that we sort of go backwards
through time in these files.

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,270
Now, this is a feature, if you will,

28
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,390
of data from Yahoo, and that's where
we got our data for this class.

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,500
Thanks very much, Yahoo.

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,546
And this is just what a real
one of those files look like.

31
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:06,848
Now later when we read the data in,
we managed to get it in the right order,

32
00:02:06,848 --> 00:02:10,020
and Dave will tell you
a little bit more about that.

33
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,420
Now, I had talked a little bit earlier
about Adjusted Close and Close.

34
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,430
Let me tell you a bit more
about what that means.

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,940
Now Close in this data
is the actual price

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,040
that was reported at the exchange
when the stock closed for that day.

37
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,520
Adjusted Close is a number that
the data provider generates for us.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,280
And it's adjusted,
as the name implies, for

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,460
certain things like stocks,
splits, and dividend payments.

40
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,560
Now, on the current day, let's pretend
for the moment that we're in 2012,

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,290
adjusted close and
close are always the same.

42
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,510
However, as we go back in time,

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,390
we eventually see that adjusted
close and close differ.

44
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,319
So if we go all the way
back to the year 2000,

45
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,726
we'll note that the actual price
the stock closed at was $25,

46
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:15,587
but this adjusted price was only $5.36.

47
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:20,869
Now, what you can observe from
that is as we go forward in time,

48
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:25,057
if we had purchased this
stock back in 2000 and

49
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:29,362
held it to 2012,
what are we looking at there?

50
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:34,262
About eight or
nine time return over those

51
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:39,980
12 years, so 800 to 900% return.

52
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,770
If you looked only at just
the actual price on the market,

53
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,720
it's only a factor of about two, but
this adjusted close reflects things like

54
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,860
I said, like dividend payments,
and splits, and so on.

55
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:00,919
So that's what is in
an actual stock CSV file.

56
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,149
And this is the data that we're going to
be working with throughout this course

57
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:07,210
and the next two parts of the course.
