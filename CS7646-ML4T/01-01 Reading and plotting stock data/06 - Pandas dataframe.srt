1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,010
We're going to make heavy use
of a library called Pandas.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,480
This library was created by
Wes McKinney at a hedge fund call AQR.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,240
It's used at many hedge funds and
by many people in the finance industry.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,610
One of the key components of Pandas
is something called the dataframe.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,520
And I'm going to show you a little
bit about what that looks like.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,410
So this is the basic
layout of a dataframe.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,810
We have our symbols along the top, so

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,190
our columns represent
symbols in the stock market.

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,330
Like, SPY which is an ETF
representing the S&P 500,

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:47,750
AAPL the symbol for Apple,
GOOG for Google, GLD for Gold.

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,714
And the rows are the dates over time, so

12
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:58,458
we go back as far as 2000,
then come all the way up to 2015.

13
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:03,393
So again, symbols from left to right,
one column for each symbol,

14
00:01:03,393 --> 00:01:05,740
and time coming down like this.

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,010
So here's our dataframe fleshed
out with a little bit of data.

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,700
I made up some of these numbers,
so it's not intended to be

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,580
gospel truth, but notice how we have,
let's say this is closing prices.

18
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:30,120
So we see these numbers for
SPY, Apple, Google, and GLD.

19
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,310
Now, there are some special or
unusual values here.

20
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,180
NaN, that stands for
not a number, and that's

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,880
Python's way of saying hey, I don't
know, I don't have information for this.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,970
The reason you see those values here is,
back in 2000, Google

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,040
did not exist as a publicly traded
company, and neither did the ETF GLD.

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,840
Now these NaN values can cause problems,
and

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,640
we'll be talking about
those in a later session.

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,320
Now as I said,
this might represent closing prices, but

27
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,970
Pandas can also handle additional data
in a sort of three dimensional sense.

28
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,167
So you can have a dataframe that
represents, again in columns,

29
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:24,790
our particular symbols,
and in rows, dates.

30
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,970
This one can be close,
we can have another one that has, for

31
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,940
the same stocks and the same dates,
volume on those dates, and

32
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,470
adjusted close, and so on.

33
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:43,260
So Pandas is a very flexible way to
read in, manipulate, and plot data.

34
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,750
Now I've shown you,
kind of at a high level,

35
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,120
what this data looks like and
what Pandas looks like.

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,490
I'm going to hand it over to Dave now,
and

37
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,220
she's going to show you some
real live examples with Pandas.

38
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,650
She's going to show you how to read
this data in, and plot it and so on.

39
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,260
So here's over to you, Dave.
