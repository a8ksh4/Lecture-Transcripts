00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,660
Thank you, Professor.

00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,690
Hey, everyone, this is Davia.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,060
So here's an example of
what the data looks like

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,550
that Professor was talking about.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,390
This is basically a comma
separated file, as you can see.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,830
And as you observe that the CSV
is in the reverse order, but

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,150
soon we will teach you how to fix that.
