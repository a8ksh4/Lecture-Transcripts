00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,009
So here's the question for you.

00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,260
Plot the high prices for the IBM.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:10,710
You can approach this problem by
first getting the CSV data of the IBM

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,270
followed by getting the high prices from
the data frame and then plotting it.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,840
You can refer to the previous example.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,340
Good luck.
