1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,110
Now let's do some plotting.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,939
It's easy to plot data
in the data frame.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:08,570
Here's how you plot
Apple's adjusted close.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,510
First let's call a library
that would help us to do this.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,200
We import a library name, matplotlib.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,750
Do not worry about the details.

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,770
You will learn them eventually
in the further lessons.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,980
But to plot the adjusting close,

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,010
we first need the adjusting
close data from the data frame.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,740
And, as you learned in
the previous video,

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,780
we can slice over the column
using the square brackets.

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,100
Plotting the adjusting close is as
simple as calling a plot function.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,450
To show the plot on your screen, we need
to add one more line and this plot.show.

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,460
Now let's run this code.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,000
Here's your first graph.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,850
You can observe there is no x-axis
label, no y-axis label, no header also

17
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,640
the data is printed in reverse order
since the CSV is in the reverse order.

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,840
So the Apple prices are not moving down,
they are just printed inversely.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,900
In the coming lessons,
you will learn how to fix it.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,170
As of now,
enjoy the power of the Python Pandas

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,390
that can plot information
using just one line of code.

22
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,400
Get ready to plot some data by yourself.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,500
I'll be back with a quiz.
