00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,510
Pandas provide a number of
functions that makes it easy

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,530
to read in data like the .csv
file we just had a look at.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,330
Here's a code that reads in
AAPL.csv into a data frame.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,850
So, first of all we will have
to import the pandas library.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,800
To avoid writing pandas every time
we use a functionality of it,

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,900
we rename it as PD.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,200
So, this is the main function,
which will call the test run function.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,450
Let's have a look what's there in it.

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,690
Pd.read_csv, as the name suggests,

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:37,950
will read AAPL.csv into a data frame,
which we name it as df.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,100
As of now, imagine dataframe as
a structure similar to the 2D arracy.

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,500
That is, with rows and columns.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,780
Let's go ahead and print this.

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,750
So here's the entire csv
file on your console.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,460
As you can see, the entire data
is loaded in your console, but

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,040
just to have an idea of the .csv file,

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,770
you can just print the top
five rows of the data frame.

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,440
This is how you do it.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,930
Data frame dot head.

20
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,550
Dot head is the functionality provided
by the pandas for the data frame

21
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,710
that would help you to view just
the top five lines of the .csv.

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,450
That will give you a rough idea of
what the .csv actually contains.

23
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,019
Let's go ahead and print this.

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,210
So here it is.

25
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,050
Just the top five lines
of your data frame.

26
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,450
You can observe that all the columns
of the .csv can be viewed here.

27
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,150
You will also observe there is
a column that is not named and

28
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,440
has values 0, 1, 2, 3.

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,590
And this is not from the .csv.

30
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,799
These are called index for the data
frame, which help you to access rows.

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:47,239
Similarly, you can view last
five values using the df.tail.
