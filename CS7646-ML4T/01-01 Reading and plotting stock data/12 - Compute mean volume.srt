1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,990
So here's the solution to find
the mean volume for the given stroke.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:05,850
As I explained,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,260
the first step would be to extract
the volume column from the data frame.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,630
The next step is to find the mean.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,720
It can be done by calling
the mean function.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,380
Let's run this code.

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,510
Here you go.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,870
The mean value for Apple,
and the mean value for IBM.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,250
I hope you enjoyed the quiz.
