1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,170
So here I've redrawn that same scenario.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,820
We've got the price of a stock,
trundling along.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,410
On this date, the dividend is announced
that it will be paid on this date.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,780
And so we see, in general,
the price rising up until that date and

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,850
then a strong drop.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:25,795
And again, the consensus value for
the company is about $100.

7
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:31,400
Let's consider now how we might adjust
historical prices for this situation.

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,230
Again, adjusted price as of today or

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,370
the latest day in our data,
is always the same as the actual price.

10
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,630
And as we go back in time,
it remains about the same

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,440
until we hit one of these events
like a dividend or a split.

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,760
So we treat, historically, the price in
the same way that we do with this split.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,780
In other words,
just before the dividend is paid,

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,320
we adjust all of these prices down
by the proportion of the dividend.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,190
So in this case we adjust
everything down by about 1%,

16
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,260
all the way back in history.

17
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,620
So our adjusted price
continues like this.

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,380
Now to double check this for
rationality,

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,320
consider that you bought
the stock around this date and

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,730
you held it all the way
though the dividend payment

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:30,330
you would get an increase in value
of your holding of about one dollar.

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,330
So the adjustment is
achieving its purpose,

23
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,780
which is to allow us to not worry
about dividends and splits.

24
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,710
Just go back in time, buy,
and hold the share, and

25
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,740
see how much our value accumulates.

26
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,694
So for the data we'll be working
with in this class, which are daily

27
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:55,530
close values, we have in our
data both actual and adjusted.

28
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,300
And in almost every instance I
will assume that we're using

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,290
adjusted closed prices
in our calculations.

30
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,750
Another couple things to reiterate about
adjustments is the last day in our file,

31
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,560
usually that's as of today, the adjusted
and actual close value are the same.

32
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,200
So any day that you look,
say you've gotta go to Yahoo Finance or

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,620
Google Finance and
you get adjusted close and

34
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,500
actual close, you'll see that today
they're exactly the same price, but

35
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,740
as you go back in time they
will begin to diverge and

36
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,140
the prices we use are adjusted for
both dividends and

37
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,970
splits, and it's very important
that you always use adjusted close.

38
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:51,810
One other thing to mention is
suppose we had this data as of 2012.

39
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:58,300
And so this last date here in our file
is some date in 2012, and you go and

40
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,240
you look at the adjusted close,
let's suppose this is some date in 2010.

41
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,810
That value, that adjusted close value,

42
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,310
will be different if you
gather data from, say, 2015.

43
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,510
So if you go to Yahoo and

44
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,377
get today's adjusted close,
there will certainly, for

45
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:26,510
most stocks, there will be dividends and
splits that have occurred since 2012.

46
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,575
And so this adjusted close
price today in Yahoo's data,

47
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:37,378
will be different, most likely
lower than the adjusted close for

48
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:41,613
that date,
if you had gathered it in 2012.

49
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:45,868
I know it's a little bit tricky,
the key point is for

50
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:52,760
projects in this class you need to use
the data that's provided for the class.

51
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,890
It was gathered as of 2012.

52
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,340
If you go to yahoo and get new data,
you're going to get different answers

53
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,930
for the projects, so
just keep that in mind.
