1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,280
Our first step in considering data is
to think about how it's aggregated.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,310
In other words, imagine that many,

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,950
many trades are happening
on different exchanges.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,590
How is all that data combined and
how is is reported back to us so

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,890
that we can analyze it and use it.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,710
The finest resolution of
data is called a tick.

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:26,780
A tick represents a successful by cell
match or a successful transaction.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,450
So let's suppose that this time
there's a successful transaction $100

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,430
was the price and 200 was the volume.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,430
So we record that here
with a single point.

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,480
A little bit later there was another
transaction 9905, a 100 shares.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,840
Now, something to keep in mind is
each of these transactions happens at

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,210
no specific time.

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,270
It happens only when the buy and
sell are matched.

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,090
So there's no guarantee
that there's going to be

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,750
a trade in any particular minute or
any particular hour.

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,280
It just happens when it happens.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,540
Each exchange provides its own data
feed regarding these transactions.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,070
So you can subscribe to these feeds and

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,650
see at each tick when a transaction
happens on any particular exchange.

21
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,290
So I've added some red
dots here that represent

22
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,920
transactions that might be
happening on another exchange.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,990
Note that the prices
are a little bit different,

24
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,160
the volumes of course
might be different.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,840
All of this happening simultaneously and

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,030
the prices of different exchanges aren't
guaranteed to be exactly the same.

27
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,700
Now for highly liquid stocks,
there may be hundreds or

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,160
thousands or hundreds of thousands of
transactions like these every second.

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,740
Collecting and using all these ticks for
all the exchanges over a long period of

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,600
time would result in a lot of data,
and it becomes very complex.

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,100
Tick data is usually consolidated into
minute by minute or hour by hour chunks.

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,100
So I've drawn some boundaries here.

33
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,100
Let's suppose those
are minute boundaries, and

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,229
we collect all the data together
within each minute, and

35
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,490
represent it as open, high,
low, close and volume.

36
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,250
So the open is the first
transaction within the time period.

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,020
So we came in here,
we had a transaction at 100, so

38
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,620
our open value is 100
within this time period.

39
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,656
High, well you look at
the entire time period and

40
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,890
you see what was the highest price.

41
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,600
The highest price here was also 100.

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,220
Low was 99.05, close is the last
transaction and that was 95.50.

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,380
And volume is just the total
volume during that time period.

44
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,130
So it's 200 plus 100 plus 300,
so 600 shares.

45
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,600
So for this minute of time
we've consolidated all that

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,730
information into open, high,
low, close, and volume.

47
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,280
Similarly we go to the next minute and
consolidate it in the same way.

48
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,520
So in this next minute our open was 99,
our close 99.95,

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,600
low is 99, high was 99.95 and
our volume was 300.

50
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,560
And we will continue throughout
the day to consolidate the data at

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,420
each minute like this.

52
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,450
And depending on your data feed,
this might be the result say,

53
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,090
for one exchange or it might be
combined across multiple exchanges.

54
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,980
In this course,
these time boundaries are in days.

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,920
So the data we'll be
working with is daily data.

56
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,950
And so we'll be looking at what is the
data at the end of the day for each day.

57
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,150
Now, all of the concepts
that we teach here,

58
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,020
you can just as easily apply
at smaller time periods.

59
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,150
It just requires more computing,
faster computing, more and

60
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,830
larger databases, and so on.

61
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,527
So that's why we look at
daily data in this course,

62
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,050
is there's a little bit
less data to work with.

63
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,020
It's easier for you to download and
work with and so on.
