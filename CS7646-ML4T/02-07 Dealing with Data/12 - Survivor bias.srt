1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,690
One of the things we do in this
class is to simulate strategies that

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,880
we might develop.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,480
We roll back time, and pretend that we
traded on certain dates according to

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,900
certain signals, and we see what the
result of our strategy might have been.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,400
Now to do that, you have to start
with some universal stocks.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,029
One of the most common
universes is the S&P 500.

7
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:25,240
When you simulate your trading,
you roll back time and

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,480
you look at that universe of stocks.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,420
You apply your algorithm to choose
which stocks you might buy.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,190
A very common mistake that people make

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,340
is that they look at the membership
of that universe, as of today.

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,200
Then they go back in time and they use
that list of stocks for their strategy.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,840
So let's suppose we go back in time,
we take the current list of the S&P 500,

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,760
and we run our strategy and
our strategy is just doing great.

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,680
I'm going to call that
the biased strategy.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,160
So why is it biased?

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,269
Well, we're selecting from stocks
way back here that we knew

18
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:09,470
were existing over here,
so there's a built in bias

19
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,520
that these stocks are going to do well
because they weathered the storm here.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,301
Now consider, what if we use
the S&P 500 as it was back in 2007?

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,950
So a lot of the stocks from
back then did just fine,

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,270
they survived, but a lot didn't.

23
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:34,730
68 stocks from the S&P 500 died.

24
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,544
They completely went away,
from 2007 to 2009.

25
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,600
So if you applied the same strategy
that appears to be so awesome,

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,710
but you use the real members
of the S&P 500 from back then,

27
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,750
you're probably going to have
a significantly lower performance.

28
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,700
And the difference between
these two is the bias.

29
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,430
The lesson learned is to use
survivor bias free data and

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,030
that's available from
a number of providers.

31
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,620
It's not usually free, but it's not
necessarily that expensive either.

32
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,660
But if you do that, you'll avoid
this sort of false optimism for

33
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,910
a strategy that you develop.

34
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,220
Okay, that's it for dealing with data.

35
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,945
I hope you found the lesson useful and
we'll see you again soon.

36
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,854
Bye-bye.
