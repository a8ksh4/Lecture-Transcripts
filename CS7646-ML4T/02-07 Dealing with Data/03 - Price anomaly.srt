00:00:00,124 --> 00:00:02,324
If you look at this
data over many years,

2
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:05,384
you'll see that there
are a couple sudden price drops.

3
00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:09,840
For instance, here it goes
from $300 to $75 in one day.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,290
Here, it goes from 250
to 125 in one day.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:21,150
So those represent a 75% drop and
a 50% drop respectively.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,550
Now surely the value of IBM did not
drop that much in just one day.

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,620
I want you to think about
why this might've happened.

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,450
In a moment, I'll give you some
options that you can choose.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,480
But why might the price of IBM

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,120
dropped by this significant
amount over these days?

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,260
Here are a few options for
you to consider.

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,530
Check the box that you
think makes the most sense.
