1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,080
So, let's start over here,
going back from today,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,450
our adjusted price is
the same as the price today.

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,790
So, as we go back and we get to this day
where there is a $100 in the actual.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,470
There's no change, it's still
a $100 also for the adjusted okay,

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,230
we go back further on this day of the
split, again, no change that would have

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,070
been $50, but we're looking to
calculate the price just before $100.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,860
In other words, when the actual price
was 100 just before that split,

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,190
what would the adjusted close be?

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,050
Well, we divide everything by 2
remember, so we would have 50 here.

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,890
So it would cruise along like this.

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,160
And again, here we divide by two because
that's what our recent split was and

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,500
we would have 25 here.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,139
So this correctly
represents that if you.

14
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:55,019
If you bought the stock on this day

15
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:59,059
it would double in value by
the time you got to this day.

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,409
And if you bought it on this day and

17
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:04,388
held it all the way to here, you would
actually get four times your value.
