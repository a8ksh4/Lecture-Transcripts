1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,750
So the correct answer is stock split.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,530
You might cry foul because I haven't
told you yet what a stock split is.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,410
But don't worry, we're getting there.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,750
But just as advance warning,
here's what it is.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,410
What happened on this day is that the
stock was selling at 300, and if you had

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,760
one share of the stock on this day, on
the very next day, you had four shares.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,549
So your total value was preserved,
you still had $300 worth of IBM,

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,970
just now you had instead of one share,
you had four shares.

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,270
That's called a stock split.
