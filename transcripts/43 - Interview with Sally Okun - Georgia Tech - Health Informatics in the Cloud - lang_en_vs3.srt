1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,590
So this morning I'm talking to
Sally Okun who's the Vice President

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:08,210
of Advocacy, Policy, and Public Safety
at Patients Like Me here in Cambridge.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,260
Sally, thank you so much for
taking the time to be with us today.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,390
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me Mark.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,350
I really appreciate
the chance to talk to you.

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,770
&gt;&gt; So we've talked before,

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,200
and I'm always fascinated by the story
of how Patients Like Me came to be.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,710
So, would you tell us that story?

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,800
&gt;&gt; Sure, absolutely.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,703
You know, it's not uncommon at all for
a one patient or

11
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:30,000
a one family story to actually
be a driver behind innovation.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,900
Whether it's in healthcare or
some other experience.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,450
And for our company,
it was very much that.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,669
So, Stephen Haywood, who was 29 at
the time he was diagnosed with ALS,

15
00:00:39,669 --> 00:00:42,129
had two brothers, Jamie and Ben Haywood.

16
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:43,621
And a good friend Jeff Cole,

17
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:47,102
who at the time of Steven's diagnosis
decided to dive in deeply and

18
00:00:47,102 --> 00:00:50,850
figure out how they might help to
stall the progression of his disease.

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,320
Or, in fact, try to cure his disease.

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,684
All of them coming out of MIT,
engineer-minded and

21
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:57,919
solution oriented, and so

22
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:01,990
they really wanted to find some ways of
being able to help Stephen through this.

23
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,940
What they found was rather frustrating.

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,140
A lot of the research wasn't
available for them to be able get at.

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,250
Some of the information that they
were receiving was conflicting.

26
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,530
And they ultimately decided that much
of what they were actually learning was

27
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,880
from other patients and families who
were dealing with the same issues.

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,040
And decided that they really needed to
find a way of being able to bring those

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,400
patients and families together to better
learn and connect with each other.

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,860
And ultimately find ways of being able
to monitor track their own experiences.

31
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,150
Bringing that together, you start to
learn about the collective experience

32
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,180
and the collective
wisdom of everyone else.

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,090
So Patients Like Me was actually
born out of that kind of model.

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,160
Bringing people together, helping them
find different ways of being able

35
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,670
to problem solve in their own times of
living with illness, but also finding

36
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,360
ways of being able to connect to the
opportunities to contribute to research.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,272
And that was a big
component of what we do.

38
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:54,660
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a wonderful story about
the ALS community on patients like me,

39
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,890
contributing to research around
a report out of Italy I think it was,

40
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,670
that maybe lithium would
benefit these patients.

41
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,650
Can you tell us about that?

42
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,270
&gt;&gt; Sure.

43
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,200
You're exactly right.

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,220
It was a small Italian study that
was done and it indicated, or

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,940
it claimed actually that the use of
lithium carbonate was actually slowing

46
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,500
the progression of ALS in
a small subset of patients.

47
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,230
What our patients on the site, who
are already part of a community that was

48
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,770
tracking and monitoring their condition,
many of them went to their doctors and

49
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,550
said I want to try Lithium.

50
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,950
And in this particular population,

51
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,190
the doctors will oftentimes try to work
with their patients to try to determine

52
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,700
an appropriate use for
an off label indication.

53
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,030
So in this case many of
the patients started using Lithium.

54
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,150
In fact,
we had about 348 patients on the site,

55
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,130
who were actively taking Lithium
under their clinician's review and

56
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,610
starting to track their
experience with that.

57
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,000
And they came to us, very activated,
to say can you help us start to gather

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,240
the data in such a way that we can
actually start to determine whether or

59
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,140
not this claim from this
study is right or wrong.

60
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,810
What we learned in a very short
period of time, quite frankly,

61
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,250
in nine months, we were able to
demonstrate with this group of patients,

62
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,710
that the claims that were made in
the initial study were not holding up,

63
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,610
that the progression was continuing.

64
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,830
There was no indication that the
progression was slowing as a result of

65
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,399
using the product.

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,090
So we took that opportunity to suggest
that this was an environment within

67
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,350
which patients who are activated and
interested in participating in research

68
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,200
could contribute their data
in a very meaningful way.

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,570
We took it to the next step, however.

70
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,660
Because we understood that
we have a biased population.

71
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,470
So our research scientists and data
scientists spent time developing a novel

72
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,570
algorithm where they could match
patients who were using Lithium

73
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,320
with patients who actually had a similar
disease course but were not on Lithium.

74
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,650
So they were able to create a control
group, that actually then was

75
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,700
useful in being able to support the
report that we ultimately showed, which

76
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,406
was that Lithium really did not have
an impact on the progression of ALS.

77
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:56,060
In fact you know, for
some patient's it could have been

78
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,890
a concern because they were actually
taking a drug that might have had

79
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,960
adverse effects that they didn't
necessarily need to incur.

80
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,360
It was a great opportunity to show the
power of the patient research network.

81
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,450
&gt;&gt; So, you began with amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis but

82
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,190
you've certainly expanded
well beyond that.

83
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,130
Can you tell us about the other
conditions or the number of

84
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,220
conditions and the number of communities
are now on Patients Like Me.

85
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,180
&gt;&gt; Sure.

86
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,420
We currently have about
270,000 patients on the site.

87
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,380
We cover over 2,000
different conditions.

88
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,520
Initially when we came out of the first
few years with Patients Like Me,

89
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,190
we were really relatively
small communities that were

90
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,290
focusing a lot on these very serious,
neurological conditions similar to ALS.

91
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,040
With MS and that sort of thing.

92
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,580
And since then we've really
expanded quite a bit.

93
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,870
So today we have communities
are focused on, Multiple Sclerosis is

94
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,860
one of our largest communities still,
about 40,000 patients.

95
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,370
We have a very large community
of fibromyalgia patients.

96
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,020
Patients for whom the system
isn't necessarily very helpful.

97
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,010
Because it's such as complex
condition with a lot of symptoms, and

98
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,919
not a treatment in sight right now.

99
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,100
Many mood conditions.

100
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,430
So we have a lot of patients
who are using the site for

101
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,190
monitoring their depression or
their anxiety disorders.

102
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,880
But then other conditions such as
epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis,

103
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,340
many of those are also in
the thousands of patients.

104
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,630
We're seeing more and more,
some of the more rare conditions and

105
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,640
often times, parents coming on to
the sites to start to monitor and

106
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,010
track their children who have some
unusual and rare conditions as well.

107
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,850
So, it's really expanded,
just, exponentially, frankly,

108
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,010
from where we began and it's very
exciting to have the opportunity to

109
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,660
have so
many different conditions represented.

110
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,510
&gt;&gt; Well this is a health
informatics course, and

111
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,590
I know from discussions we've had
in the past that there is a lot of

112
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,640
informatics sitting under this beautiful
user friendly, non technical site.

113
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,980
Can you tell us a bit about what it
takes to actually make this thing work?

114
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,710
&gt;&gt; Sure it does take
a lot of engineering.

115
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,210
Much of our company,
we have about 80 staff now.

116
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,510
Much of our company are engineers,
software developers,

117
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,460
designers, user experience specialists.

118
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,560
Then we also have the other side of
the house which is research scientists,

119
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,290
data scientist and clinicians, who are
trying to bring the two worlds together,

120
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,780
very much in health IT perspective.

121
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,500
So on the clinical side, for example, we
actually take all of the data that comes

122
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,660
in from patients, and we actually
code that against the standardized

123
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,260
terminologies that you would find in
an electronic health record for example.

124
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,630
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us which ones?

125
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,740
&gt;&gt; Sure, we actually code against most
of the ones that you would imagine.

126
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,540
So ICD, SNOMED, we use mEDRA for
side effect data,

127
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,200
which is what the pharmaceutical
industry as well as the FDA uses for

128
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,000
monitoring adverse events.

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,480
We use Multum database right now for
our drug database.

130
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,130
But we're moving more
towards using RxNorm.

131
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,940
Again another one of the standardized
terminologies that's within

132
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,110
the UMLS library.

133
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,910
So we try very much to
use existing standardized

134
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,240
databases in order to be able to
normalize our data in some way.

135
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,420
So that it ultimately could be able to
be interoperable with other systems.

136
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,980
Right now that's not as transparent
on the site as you might imagine, but

137
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,700
when you go behind the scenes,
we can then begin to look at

138
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,370
how many ways have people
talked about their symptom,

139
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,850
against a particular
specific clinical concept.

140
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,930
And there could be 30 different
ways that patients actually express

141
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,620
one clinical concept.

142
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,140
So, that's actually contributing to
the development of a patient vocabulary

143
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,450
that actually maps back
to clinical concepts.

144
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,280
And there's probably close to eight or
9,000 terms in there now that are in

145
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,600
patient's voice that we've actually
then mapped to clinical concepts.

146
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,190
&gt;&gt; Super.

147
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,350
I know you've recently, we talked
earlier about clinical research, and

148
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,080
you emphasized that the Lithium study
really isn't a controlled trial,

149
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,120
in the classic sense.

150
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,950
But you guys are helping your users,

151
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,320
your patients find and get involved
in clinical trials, I understand.

152
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,600
Can you tell us about that?

153
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,280
&gt;&gt; I can.
And we have a few ways of doing that.

154
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,090
One is that we download every night,
the data from cliinicaltrials.gov.

155
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,830
And so a patient can look at their
profile the next morning and see,

156
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,160
based on their profile data, which
trials they actually matched against,

157
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,740
within 25 miles of their home.

158
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,930
Gives them a place to begin.

159
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,250
Then we've also just recently
announced a service that we're

160
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,460
going to be provided to
the pharmaceutical industry.

161
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,090
It's called Trial Access.

162
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,150
We've learned from our patients through
surveys that we've done with them,

163
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,690
that many of them have been invited
to participate in trials, and

164
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,310
many of them have not been
satisfied with the experience of

165
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,140
those who actually did participate.

166
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,760
Sometimes it's because there wasn't
enough patient-oriented consideration

167
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,600
into what it took to
participate in a trial.

168
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,840
So what we've learned is that by having
this service called Trial Access,

169
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,659
we're actually going to be
helping patients participate

170
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,789
in the development of trials,
right from the very start.

171
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,110
So they're better able to say, this
particular intervention is going to be

172
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,650
very inconvenient for
me to be able to do.

173
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,010
Had you considered that?

174
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,310
Now another way of being able
to state that could be, if

175
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,810
I'm going to have to have a blood sample
drawn, we need to determine how far away

176
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,210
I'm going to need to go to get that, or
can someone come to my home and do that?

177
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,607
So there's different ways that patients
can actually contribute practical advice

178
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:05,435
to the child development [CROSS_TALK].

179
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:07,194
&gt;&gt; So patient-centered clinical trials.

180
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:07,731
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

181
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:08,415
&gt;&gt; A new concept.

182
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,930
&gt;&gt; All the way through the system.

183
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,690
And actually even also to the point
where they are participating in

184
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,370
the evaluation of that trial.

185
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,130
How did it go?

186
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,825
And being able to get some
findings back to them.

187
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:20,005
Right now,
you participate in a clinical trial and

188
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:22,625
you never know what the outcomes
of that trial were.

189
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,995
And if you have access to a journal, you
might be able to find the publication at

190
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:29,215
some point, but
much of that data isn't published.

191
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:30,955
What we're saying, and
we're suggesting, and

192
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:34,475
we're hoping, that the industry
really begins to embrace.

193
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:35,925
Patients need to have some feedback.

194
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:38,745
There needs to be a mechanism that
if I've contributed my data and

195
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm participating in this study.

196
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,350
I'd like to have some sense
of how it all went and

197
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,020
how it did contribute to new knowledge.

198
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,190
&gt;&gt; Well great, so that sort of leads
to my last question, which is,

199
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,770
I'm going to ask you to
get out your crystal ball.

200
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,120
What do you see as the future
of Patients Like Me,

201
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,080
at least that you can discuss?

202
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,590
And specifically,

203
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,590
and I'm not sure I know the answer
to this one, as I'll be interested.

204
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,280
How do you see Patients Like Me
being involved in VDT, the move for

205
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,190
patients to be able to upload
their electronic records and

206
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,140
share their data with each other and
with other clinicians?

207
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,850
Well, we have a lot of
exciting things going on.

208
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,390
And some of the projects that
we're currently working on

209
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,440
are very much about that.

210
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,300
We're doing some testing and
piloting of sensors and

211
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,960
mobile devices and wearables.

212
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,910
Trying to figure out ways of being able
to give patients the opportunity to have

213
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,360
access to these devices, bringing
that data into our platform, and then

214
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,390
ultimately finding a way of bringing
that data into the clinical records, so

215
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,080
it can be useful.

216
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,200
But there's a lot that you, as you might
imagine, that goes along with that.

217
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,320
We need to think about how
do we standardize that data,

218
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,590
how do we understand how
to code that data so,

219
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,640
we're just really beginning to learn and
those projects are just launched.

220
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,800
We've just actually sent out the
packages to the patient participants, so

221
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,470
they can start to do that
active data collection.

222
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,080
We see the platform as being an
environment where patients can truly be

223
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,490
a part of the changing healthcare
system in an area where we've

224
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,340
never really had access to their voice
in such a systematic way before.

225
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,050
And we believe that, actually,
that contribution will

226
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,420
really help us achieve the promise of
a continuously learning health system.

227
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,220
Without that voice, we're sort of
operating in a bit of a vacuum.

228
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,220
So we are continuing to build
the platform with that in mind.

229
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,570
We hope, within the next year or so,
to really have the ability to have that

230
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,825
interoperability data exchange, so that
we might be able to pull in data from

231
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:31,450
an EHR record, to unburden the patient
from having to enter all that data in.

232
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,330
But you know,
there's another facet to that.

233
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,200
The patient can also verify the data.

234
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,860
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

235
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,130
&gt;&gt; And really reconcile
the medication list for example,

236
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,150
as part of the helping to then
achieve something that an electronic

237
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,960
health record holder needs to do.

238
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,760
They need to reconcile
the medication record and

239
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,320
this is a way of being able to do that.

240
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,330
So there's a variety of ways that we see
our ability to be able to take advantage

241
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,360
of that kind of view, download and
transmit type of technology.

242
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,460
But we want it to be bidirectional.

243
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,320
Let's get data going back and forth.

244
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,030
So that ultimately each record is
a reflection of the full 360 view of

245
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,870
the patient.

246
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,120
&gt;&gt; You raise a really interesting point.

247
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,350
I was at a talk recently from
someone at the Geisinger Clinic.

248
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,620
Which is a very well known
health system in Pennsylvania.

249
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,810
And they have an open chart initiative,

250
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,310
which allows patients to
see their actual charts.

251
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,780
And one of the benefits they've
seen is that patients find and

252
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,910
help them correct mistakes.

253
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,300
&gt;&gt; Errors, exactly.

254
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,100
You know, it's really very common for

255
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,660
something to be on a record that isn't
quite accurate, or for a patient to see

256
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,010
a medication that they may have taken,
ten years ago, but no longer take, and

257
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,240
be able to say to the doctor, this is
not accurate let's fix it together.

258
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,860
One of the things I've been playing
around with is this equation, and

259
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,207
I've been talking about it a lot lately,
and that's this notion of shared data.

260
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,800
So my data as a patient, your data
as a clinician, our data together.

261
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,470
Actually can, when you add that into
a shared decision making model,

262
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,620
ultimately leads to a shared
accountability for the outcomes.

263
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,490
So that we actually all have
the opportunity to share in

264
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,410
the ways that I can improve my health.

265
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,070
I can have my health be more
reflective of what matters to me.

266
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,270
But at the same time I'm understanding
the kinds of things that are,

267
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,540
a clinician needs to know in order
to be able to take better care of

268
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,980
the needs that I have so.

269
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,430
&gt;&gt; Well as soon as I
get back to Atlanta,

270
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm going to encourage our
friend Marla to sign up.

271
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,700
So if you see a woman with a lot
of problems named Marla sign up,

272
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
you should know that I sent her to you.

273
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,190
&gt;&gt; Well the other thing to keep in mind
with that in mind is that the site has

274
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,680
levels of privacy that allow a patient
to use a username or their real name.

275
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,380
But I would want to be sure that people
do know that we do take great strides to

276
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,370
be sure that the experience for patients
is safe, they can trust the site,

277
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,040
they can feel comfortable about
being able to exchange information.

278
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,390
&gt;&gt; Students know who Marly is,
you don't.

279
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,440
&gt;&gt; I don't [LAUGH].

280
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,330
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

281
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,290
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

282
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,010
&gt;&gt; Great talking to you.
